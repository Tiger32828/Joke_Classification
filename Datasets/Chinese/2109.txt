One Sunday morning, Xiao Ming's parents asked him to go to the balcony to report what happened nearby, and they used the time to have sex.
Xiao Ming looked and said, "There are three stray dogs below... Xiao Li is washing his father's car, and Xiao Hua's parents are having sex."
Xiao Ming's father stopped having sex immediately after hearing this, and asked Xiao Ming very strangely: "Child, how do you know what Xiao Hua's parents are doing?"
Xiao Ming quickly replied, "Of course, Xiao Hua is standing on the balcony."
