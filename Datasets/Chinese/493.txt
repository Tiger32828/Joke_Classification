The boss recruited a clerk and said:
"You've been with the company for a year, and you started out with just distributing letters.
Started handling sales in a week, was promoted to regional manager of the sales department in a month, and was promoted to vice president in just four months.
Now that I'm retiring, I want you to be the new president and general manager of the company. What do you think? ! "

The clerk said, "Thank you..."
Boss: "Is there anything else to say?"
Staff: "Thank you! Dad!"
