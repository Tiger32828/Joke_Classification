A couple is sleeping in bed, the husband taps his wife on the shoulder and says, "Shall we do a hobby?"
The wife said, "No, I'm going to see the obstetrician tomorrow. I don't want him to smell anything."
After a while, the husband gently tapped his wife on the shoulder and said:
"So are you going to see the dentist tomorrow?"
