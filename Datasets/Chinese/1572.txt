A father takes his young son to camp in the wild and asks him to experience a simple life.
When the father stretched his hands into the mountain stream and held up the water, the child stared and shouted, "Father, don't you want to drink it?"
"Of course I'll drink it," my father said, gulping down the water he was holding in his hands.
"Oops, Dad," said the child, "I'm not talking about water, but tadpoles in water."
