There is a scholar who is going to take the exam. He is worried day and night, and his strange appearance makes his wife puzzled.
She said, "Look at your idiot, is it harder for men to write articles than for women to have children?"
The scholar sighed, "It's always easier for a woman to give birth to a child than to write an essay!"
The woman asked again, "Why?"
The scholar replied: "Women have children in their wombs, and they can always give birth, but my stomach is empty, how can I write an article?"
