At night, a robber broke into the dentist's house and asked the doctor for money. The doctor said, tremblingly, "I really don't have any money for you."
The robber shook his hand and slapped the doctor, causing the doctor to cry. The doctor cried and said:
"Your Majesty, spare your life, I really don't have any money. If you really don't want to go there in vain, I can pull out a few teeth for you for free."
