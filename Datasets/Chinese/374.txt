The newly arrived nurse's sister had poor drip skills, so the head nurse specially found a sleeping patient to try injections for her.
She took an injection, but it went wrong. Seeing that the patient was still awake, she quietly pulled it out and gave it a heavy injection. As a result, one injection after another, she unknowingly hit her from head to toe, just when her sister was sweating and wanted to find another injection location. .....
The patient jumped up and roared and scolded: "Are you fucking dead as if I was sleeping? Stabbed from head to toe!" The younger sister fled.
The next day I went to work and was called to the dean's room. The dean excitedly held the nurse's sister's hand and said, "Thank you, thank you so much, you really do...the 8-year-old vegetative person was actually woken up by you."
