Someone heard that some kind of operation would give him a new brain, so he went into the hospital and asked the doctor what was in storage.
"It's the brain of a great engineer, $500 an ounce."
"What else?"
"It's a lawyer's brain, $1,000 an ounce."
"Do you have anything else?"
The doctors looked at each other, then motioned him to a covered container.
"It's the Congressman's brain," they said softly. "It costs $250,000 an ounce."
"Ah! Why is it so expensive?" the man exclaimed.
The doctors said to him, "First, this brain is barely used; second, do you know how many MPs it takes to get an ounce of brain?"
