One day, the teacher brought a group of children to the mountain to pick fruits. She announced, "Children, after picking the fruits, we will wash them together. After washing, we can eat them together."
All the children went to pick fruit.
When the gathering time came, all the children gathered.
Teacher: "Xiaohua, what did you get?"
Xiaohua: "I'm washing apples because I'm picking apples."
Teacher: "How about you, Xiaomei?"
Xiaomei: "I'm washing tomatoes because I picked tomatoes."
Teacher: "The kids are great! What about you, Amin?"
Amin: "I was washing cloth shoes because I stepped on the stool."
