One day I suddenly found out that I have an aunt, a second aunt, a fourth aunt, and a fifth aunt, but no third aunt.
So I asked my dad, "Why don't I have a third aunt?"
I also thought for a while: "Could it be that the third aunt died when she was young?"
My dad said angrily, "Your third aunt is your mother!"
