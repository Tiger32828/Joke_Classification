An 80-year-old man goes for a health check.
During the examination, the old man kept showing off to the doctor how good and how good his newlywed wife was.
"She is only twenty-five!" cried the old man:
"Four months of marriage, do you know how loyal she is to me? She needs me all the time, and she's tired of sticking to me!
"And," the old man added, "I tell you, she was pregnant recently!
The doctor listened quietly, without saying a word.
"How?" the old man said triumphantly. "Not bad, right?"
The doctor raised his head and glanced at him: "This reminds me of a long-lost friendâ€”"
The doctor spoke slowly: "He told me a story about what he encountered while hunting in Africa."
"At that time, he was on the grassland and came across a lion. He immediately grabbed the gun from his back and aimed it.
However, he immediately discovered that he was wrong and that he was getting an umbrella, not a gun. It's too late now,
The lion was standing in front of him and was about to pounce. He had no choice but to buckle the umbrella over his shoulders,
With all the power of sucking, "Bang! boom! boom! ' shouted three times. Miraculously, the lion fell down and died. "
"What a joke! How is this possible?" the old man exclaimed. "It must have been someone else!"
"I hold the same opinion about your wife's pregnancy," the doctor said.
