I have participated in various committee meetings and have learned the samadhi:
Don't come to the meeting on time, or people will think you're a fledgling.
If you don't talk until halfway through the meeting, people will think you're smart.
Try to be as far as possible, so as not to offend people.
When in doubt, it is recommended to appoint a team.
The first adjournment makes you popular - that's what everyone is waiting for.
