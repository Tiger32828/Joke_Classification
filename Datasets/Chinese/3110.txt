The wolf swallowed a bone, and the bone got stuck in his throat and couldn't swallow it.
So the wolf went to Grey Crane and said, "You take the bone out of my throat, and I will repay you well!"
The gray bird put its head into the wolf's mouth, took out the bone with its long beak, and said to the wolf, "Pay me now!"
The wolf said, "Humph! You stuck your head in my mouth just now, and I didn't bite your head off, aren't you satisfied?"
