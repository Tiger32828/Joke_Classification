When the call came, the younger son of the elementary school was studying at the desk,
High school eldest son practicing guitar with door closed
I turn off the sound of the tv and pick it up
"Uh... um... Mom, save me!"
"Your son is in my hands! If you don't..."
"Sir, I'm sorry," I tried to be polite even though it was an inexplicable scam call.
"My two sons are at home"

There was only a moment of silence on the phone, and then he spoke.......

"...You...your family is fake!"
