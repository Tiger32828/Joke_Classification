The young daughter ran to her mother's bedroom and begged her to tell her a story.
Mom rubbed her sleepy eyes and looked at the clock "four o'clock in the middle of the night"
So he said, "It's very late now, can we talk about it tomorrow?"
Helpless, my daughter had to listen, so she had to say, "Okay, come to the bed. When your father comes back, there must be a story to tell us."
