The young man asked the Zen master, "I feel that I am superfluous in this world, and no one needs me."
The Zen master said, "Just like the mathematics you learn, no matter how complicated and difficult a function is, there is a suitable graph corresponding to it. You just haven't found that graph."
The young man pondered and wrote down the analytical formula of the Dirichlet function.

(The analytic formula of the Dirichlet function is not derivable everywhere, and it is discontinuous everywhere, so it is impossible to draw an image, but the image exists objectively.)
