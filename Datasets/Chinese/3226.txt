The electrician was fixing the TV in the living room, with my husband following behind, asking a lot of questions.
The attitude of the workers was very friendly, answering any questions they had, after the workers left.
The husband said, "As a result of this interview, I got a lot of new technology. Next time the TV breaks down, I can repair it myself. Also, now I know how to repair the refrigerator."
Before long, it was ten yuan for a TV switch, eight yuan for wages, and one hundred yuan for technical guidance.
