There was once a student who studied statistics. When he was driving, he always accelerated at the intersection, whizzed past, and then slowed down again. One day he took a passenger, who was terrified by the way he was driving and asked why he was driving like that.

The student replied, "That's right. From a statistical point of view, intersections are the most accident-prone sections, so I want to spend as little time as possible."
