Mosquito saw Jianming's palm and took a bite. An angry Jianming was about to reach out to hit the mosquito when the mosquito shouted, "Forgive me! Today is my birthday"
Jianming thought about it, decided to let the mosquitoes go, clapped his hands and sang: "Happy birthday to you, I wish you..."

As a result, the mosquitoes still died.
