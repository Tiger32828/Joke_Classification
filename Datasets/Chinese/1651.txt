A man made a blind date on TV, and sat opposite a girl in the Linjiangxi restaurant.
After learning about both sides' jobs, education, family, hobbies, the conversation got stuck.
So the man started talking about social topics.
The man asked, "How do you view the housing market (intercourse)?"
The girl froze for a moment, blushed and said, "It's better not to be too frequent before marriage!"
