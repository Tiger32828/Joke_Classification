An American factory manager led a customer from the Iron Curtain country to visit his factory,
When the noon whistle sounded, tens of thousands of workers quickly dispersed, and the guest was very horrified: "They all escaped!"
"Don't worry!" said the factory manager. "They'll be back."
The guests looked at him in disbelief, but when the whistle for work went off, the workers all came back to work.
Later, when the factory manager talked about the business, he said, "About the machines you plan to buy..."
The customer of the Iron Curtain Country interjected and said, "Then we will have a chance to discuss it later, but now tell me how much your whistle will sell for?"
