As the saying goes: "A cigarette after a meal is like a fairy."
One day, after eating, Lao Wang looked at the newspaper and smoked a cigarette.
The wife said to Lao Wang, "I saw the news today that smoking a cigarette will reduce your life expectancy by 5 minutes."
After listening to the old king, he laughed three times: "Hahaha!"
The wife was a little angry: "What are you laughing at?"
Pharaoh replied: "It was written in the newspaper that laughing once can add 7 minutes to my life, so I have extended my life by 2 minutes."
