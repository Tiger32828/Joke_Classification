This is a conversation a girl has had with her mother since she was a child...
Primary school: "Mom, I won't marry when I grow up, I will always be by your side."
Junior high school: "Mom, I want to live with you when I grow up."
High school: "Mom, when I grow up and get married, I will often come back to see you."
University: "Mom, when I grow up and get married, I will find time to come back to see you."
When getting married: "Mom, come see me when you are free."
After getting married: "Mom, don't come to me if you're okay. _x0008_"
