Mathematicians and physicists were in the garden, and the garden owner pointed to a pile of wood and said:
"Please use these wood to try to enclose the largest area."
The mathematician made a circle with all the wood and said confidently, "This is the largest area without error."
The physicist surrounded a small circle with a small amount of wood, then stood inside and said, "I define myself outside."
