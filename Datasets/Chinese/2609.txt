A high school boy was standing behind the bus driver when he didn't expect a sudden emergency brake!
When he was in a hurry, he grabbed the coin box next to him, but he pulled out the coin box entirely.
The driver wanted to laugh when he saw it, but said calmly, "Sir, we are a small business, please be merciful!"
