God said that the three world-class heads of state have a very rare opportunity to meet with God! Allow everyone to ask a question!

The first is that US President Trump asked God first: "God! When will the American people have a real good life?"
God replied, "You'll have to wait fifty years for the American people to have a really good life"
Trump cried: "Ugh... I'm afraid I won't be able to wait until then..."

The second was Russian President Vladimir Putin asking God: "God! When will the Russian people have a really good life?"
God replied: "You will have to wait a hundred years before the Russian people will have a really good life"
Putin also cried: "Ugh... I'm afraid I won't be able to wait until then..."

The third is Xi Jinping asking God: "God! When will the Chinese people have a real good life?"
At this time, God cried out loudly: "Ugh...I...I'm afraid I can't wait for that time..."
