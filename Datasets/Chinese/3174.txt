One evening, while waiting for a train in New Delhi, I saw a soldier crossing the track instead of the flyover.
Suddenly, the sound of the flag lowering came from a nearby army unit. He was worthy of his training.
Standing at attention right in the middle of the track, he didn't seem to notice a large internal combustion engine train rushing towards him.
The train driver saw the soldier and immediately braked and waited. The last trumpet died away,
The soldier waved his hand to the driver with a smile and climbed to the opposite platform.
