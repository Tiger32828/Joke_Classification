Xiaogang suddenly thought of going to his newly married twin brother's house to play.
The elder brother said, "Let's stay for dinner! Your sister-in-law went out to buy food."
Soon my brother went out to run errands, leaving Xiaogang watching TV in the living room.
Near noon, when my sister-in-law came back from grocery shopping, she saw Xiaogang running over and hugging and kissing.
During the whole process, Xiaogang deliberately pretended to be stupid and followed her tossing, and smiled inwardly: "It's cool to have a twin brother!"
After looking at it, he said lightly, "My brother is out!"
Unexpectedly, my sister-in-law muttered, "I know!" Xiaogang felt bad in an instant!
