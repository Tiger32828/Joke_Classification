Xiao Ming will go to heaven one day
I saw that there are so many clocks in heaven
Xiao Ming asked God, "Oh my God, why are there so many clocks here?"
God said, "Every clock here represents a person, and the faster the hands turn, the more stupid the person is."
Xiao Ming: God, "Where's my clock?"
God replied, "Yours, I used it as an electric fan."
