There are two young people in the village
The male is called H, the female is called T
They love each other but are opposed by the villagers
In the end they jumped into the creek at night to die for love
The villagers felt regretful and ashamed when they found out
In honor of H and T, the villagers named the stream as

"HT Stream"
