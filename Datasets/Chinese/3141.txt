Mark Twain once gave a speech on honesty and told this story:
"I was walking down the street when I was a kid and I came across a wagon full of watermelons.
I like to eat watermelon, so I sneaked over and stole one, then ran into a nearby alley,
Get ready to have a good meal. I took a bite, and suddenly it didn't taste right. I made up my mind without hesitation.
Go back to the wagon and put the watermelon in - get another ripe one. "
