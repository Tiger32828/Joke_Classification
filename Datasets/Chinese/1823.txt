Once upon a time, a man who was not very good at English was flirting with a foreign girl.
Once in love, the man said to the foreign girl's girlfriend in not very good English: "I Love You!"
The foreign girl heard the great joy and said, "I Love You too!"
The man didn't know why, but said, "I Love You three!"
babes: "????"
