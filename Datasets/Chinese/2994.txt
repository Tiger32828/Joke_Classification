The Romans liked to watch fighting beasts. One day, a big bull appeared in the Colosseum, and the bullfighter didn't even stab him 100 times.
The emperor was also present that day, and he ordered the bullfighter to be given a wreath.
Everyone was puzzled, and the emperor said: "Look, it's really not easy to stab such a behemoth without even stabbing 100 shots!"
