A couple traveled to Europe together. After getting on the plane, they found that the seats were not adjacent, so the husband asked the flight attendant to ask.
"Hey, miss, miss... I'm husband and wife, why didn't we get a seat together?"
Stewardess: "Sir, I'm sorry, we are planning a flight, not a bed!"
