One night, American railroad tycoon Stu-yvesant Fish and his wife were sitting at their home in New York. His wife suddenly coughed.
He asked thoughtfully, "Would you like something to ease your throat?"
The lady stopped coughing and replied, "Okay! Just the diamond necklace I saw at the jewelry store today."
