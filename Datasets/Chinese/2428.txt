One day, the manager of a certain division came to the 206 division to participate in the fourth division to negotiate with the public.
The manager's English is very good, so I want to brand it
There was only one engineer officer in the office who would never pass the English test.
Manager: "Hi." (Hello!)
Engineer Officer: "You have what thing?"
Manager: "Can you speak English?" (Can you speak English?)
Engineer officer: "If I not speak English, I am speaking what?"
(If I don't speak English, what am I talking about?)
Manager: "Can any bodyelse speak English?"
(Does anyone else speak English?)
Engineer officer: "You yourself look. No man here
you can wait, you wait, you not wait, you go! "
(Look for yourself, no one else can wait for you; go without waiting!)
Manager: "Good heavens. Any body here can speak English?"
(Omg! Does anyone here speak English?)
Engineer: "Shout what shout, quiet a little, you on earth have
what thing? "
(What are you shouting? Be quiet for a while, what the hell is wrong with you?)
Manager: "I want to speak to your head."
(I want to talk to your boss)
Engineer Officer: "Head not zai. You tomorrow come!"
(No head, you come tomorrow!)
