Physicists, astronomers and mathematicians were walking on the Scottish Highlands when they came across a black sheep.
"Ah!" said the astronomer, "so sheep in Scotland are black."
"Come on, you can't say that based on just one observation," the physicist said. "You can only say that the black sheep was found in Scotland."
"Nor," said the mathematician. "From this observation, all you can say is that at this moment, the sheep, from our point of view, is ostensibly black on one side."
