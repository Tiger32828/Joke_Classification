A certain African chief visited London, and reporters surrounded him at the airport:
"Good morning, Mr. Chief!" one of them asked. "Was your trip comfortable?"
The chief made a series of very harsh voices: "Coax - hum - squeak - hiss..."
Then, unexpectedly, in exceptionally pure English, he said, "Yes, very comfortable."
"Then how long are you going to stay here?"
"Coax - hum - squeak - hiss..." The chief made another series of noises,
Then he replied, "About two weeks! I think."
"Chief, can you tell me where you learned such fluent English?" asked the bewildered reporter.
"Coax—hum—squeak—hiss...from the shortwave radio."
