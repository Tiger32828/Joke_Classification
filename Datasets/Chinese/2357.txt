A mosquito has been hungry for a day, and it has been a long time since it had sucked blood thanks to the new radar.
It wandered around and finally found a family that didn't use radar!
The old grandmother is telling a story to the little grandson, and she can suck it up now.
Mosquito rushed towards the child, and suddenly smelled the smell of mosquitoes, so dangerous! what should I do?
Suddenly, a smile appeared on its face. The grandmother didn't like the smell of mosquitoes, so she didn't apply it. Haha, don't miss it!
With a "whoosh", the mosquito rushed over and bit the grandmother's face.
"You have mosquitoes on your face!" said the little grandson.
"It doesn't matter!" After speaking, the grandmother smiled slightly, and the poor mosquito was squeezed to death by the grandmother's wrinkles.
