One person was invited to a family dinner by a friend. The friend was very stingy and only served him a few drops of white wine.
Before leaving, the man said to his friend, "Excuse me again, please slap me on the left and right cheeks!"
When a friend asked the reason, the man said, "In this case, my face is flushed, and my wife knows that I have eaten and drank enough at your house. Otherwise, it is difficult to explain!"
The stingy friend also felt embarrassed and took out a large wine glass.
However, only covering the bottom of the glass when pouring the wine, the man asked his friend for a saw.
The friend was very strange, and the man replied, "I want to saw off the useless upper half of this cup."
