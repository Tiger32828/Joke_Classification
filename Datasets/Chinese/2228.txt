Mother: "Tomorrow I have to take the water heater grade C exam. I'm so nervous. I've already helped you find a good relationship."
Son: "True or false! How do you find a relationship for the national exam?"
Mother: "Although the background is very hard, the exam process still has to go through it again."
Son: "Hahaha it's so fake! Who are you looking for?"
Mother: "Marshal of the Central Altar of Qing'an Palace in Fucheng"
Child: "Good night."
