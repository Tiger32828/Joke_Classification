One day after school, my friends and I walked out of the school gate, just to see a bus coming from a distance.
When I was about to pull my friend to take the bus, I was suddenly stopped by the pickets. It turned out to be because my uniform was too stretched out;
I hurriedly wrote my name on the roster, and hurriedly took my classmates to take the bus.
But the bus left early! As soon as I turned my head, I realized that I had actually dragged the pickets to the station!
I saw my friend standing in the same place laughing all the time.
