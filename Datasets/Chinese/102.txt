When riding the school bus, Xiaoqiang found a very sweet and beautiful girl in the window seat on the bus.
He was immediately attracted to her, so he gathered up his courage and wrote a note to her, asking if she would like to be his friend.
And it was marked on the note: "If you want, send the note back; if you don't want to, throw the note out the window."
The results of it? The note was sent back, but there were a few words on it, "The window can't be opened!"
