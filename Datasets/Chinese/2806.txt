One afternoon, my father was sitting in his study, burying his head in the report he was about to make.
From the garden came the son's loud cry: "Dad, Daddy, look out the window!"
"What a nasty boy!" he complained, dropping the report. "What did you say?" He stuck his head out of the window.
"Nothing, Dad." The younger son replied, "Xiao Ming and Xiao Hai don't believe that you don't have a hair on your head."
