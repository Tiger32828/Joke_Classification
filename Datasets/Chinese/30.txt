A customer was withdrawing money from an ATM, but his card was swallowed due to improper operation.
The customer was very anxious, and immediately went to the counter and asked, "Miss, my card has been swallowed by the machine! What should I do?"
The lady at the counter not only didn't laugh, but said to the customer very calmly: "No wonder I found a machine missing during the inventory this morning. It turned out to be swallowed by your card!"
All the colleagues burst into laughter, and the customers also laughed.
