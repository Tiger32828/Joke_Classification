When a businessman was at his peak, one day he accompanied his father into a very rich restaurant for dinner, where a talented violinist was playing Qin in the band.
Remembering how his father used to want him to learn the violin but didn't, he said to his father, "If I had heard you before, I might be playing here now."
"Yes, boy," his father replied, "but then you wouldn't be eating here now."
