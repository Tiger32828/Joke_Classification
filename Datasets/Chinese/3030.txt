Darwin was invited to dinner.
At the banquet, he happened to be sitting side by side with a young and beautiful lady.
"Mr Darwin," the beautiful woman sitting next to the scientist asked the scientist in a playful tone,
"I heard your assertion that humans came from monkeys. Am I among your assertions?"
"Of course!" Darwin glanced at her and replied politely, "But you didn't change from an ordinary monkey, but from a very charming monkey."
