A couple visited the farm, and the owner proudly introduced a champion breeding cow.
The wife asked, "How many times a week does it mate?"
The farmer said, "Five or six times."
The wife immediately said to the husband in a disdainful tone: "Look! They are five or six times a week."
The farmer quickly helped the gentleman and said, "Of course, we never let it mate with the same cow all the time."
