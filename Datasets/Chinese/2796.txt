The customs officer asked an old woman, "Excuse me, what are these bottles that you brought?"
"Holy water," said the old woman. "I filled it in a church when I traveled to France."
The customs officers didn't believe it, and when they opened one of the bottles, the general brandy smell wafted out.
"Ma'am, what's your explanation for this?"
"Ah! Almighty God!" cried the old woman. "When I set off, it was just a bottle of water, and now... it's a miracle! It's a miracle!"
