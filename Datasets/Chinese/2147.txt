During dinner last night, Grandpa suddenly said to me, "There is a piece of land in the house that belongs to you."
At the moment, I held back my tears and thought to myself, "I knew that I was actually the second generation of the invisible rich! The poor days before were all to sharpen me!
Now the time is finally ripe! "
I forcibly restrained the excitement in my heart and tried to answer him in a calm and casual tone: "Oh, where is it?"
Grandpa said, "On the table, I signed for the "Express" of Hsinchu Freight Forwarding for you in the morning."
