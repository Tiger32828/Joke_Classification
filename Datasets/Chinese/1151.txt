An elderly grandmother wanted to travel abroad, so she opened the newspaper and read, "Four days in Ryukyu, only 13,999 yuan."
haha, cheap! I went to play for four days and came back.
Grandma thinks it's good, and wants to go abroad to play again, and then read the newspaper, "Naha four-day tour, only 13,999 yuan"
Cheap! So she was very happy to sign up to play again.
As soon as she arrived in Naha, she felt very strange, why did she seem to know each other? But still full of fun, and happy to return home.
After my grandma returned to China, she felt that she would live until she was old and learned, and she wanted to go abroad to expand her knowledge and read the newspaper.
Ha ha! Another cheap place.
However, she felt a little puzzled this time, and thought to herself, "Why are the prices the same, are you lying to me?"
But she is still happy to travel!
After returning to China, she thought to herself, why do they all look the same abroad?
But I thought to myself that after reading ten thousand volumes of books and traveling ten thousand miles, the country that wrote English might look different. I read the newspaper again and said, "Okinawa, only 13,999 yuan."
Haha, those who write in English must be in a far country, so I excitedly participated in the fourth overseas trip in my life.
After returning to China, the grandson saw grandma coming back, so he was very happy and asked, "Grandma! Okinawa is having fun, isn't it?"
Grandma said with a look of disdain, "I'll never go abroad again! It's the same abroad!"
