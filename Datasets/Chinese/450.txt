A grandmother sent a Line to a good grandson: "You are in trouble, hurry up and hide, your teacher skipped class because of you, and now comes to our house to find you!"
The good grandson replied: "Grandma, it's you who want to hide quickly! Because I called the teacher today to ask for leave, saying that grandma passed away, so I won't go to school today!"
As a result, grandma had already opened the door with the teacher, and the teacher said in surprise, "You are old..."
Grandma was also very surprised and said to the teacher, "How can you see me? I'll come back to see it for the first seven days today. I'm sorry, the teacher is surprised!"
The teacher foamed at the mouth and fainted.
