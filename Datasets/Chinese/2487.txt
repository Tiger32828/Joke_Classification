French and Americans chat together.
French: "Our French flag is very interesting, it perfectly expresses the thoughts and feelings of our taxpayers -

Red is a symbol of our angry faces when we pay our taxes. "
American: "Our American flag is more interesting, to highlight that we have a tax bill
Immediately after the blow, we drew many stars on the flag. "
