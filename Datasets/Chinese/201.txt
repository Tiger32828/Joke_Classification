After hours my family was very poor, sometimes so poor that the whole family only had money.
There is nothing else. Dad is busy counting money, mother is busy sweeping money, brother has no quilt to sleep, so he has to cover money, and sister has no toilet paper to poop, so she has to use money to wipe her ass.
I can only read books every night in the light of burning money, so my myopia is very deep.
In fact, my family used to be even more pitiful. Everyone said, "There is a small river in front of my house and a hillside behind it."
But the Pacific Ocean is in front of and behind my house, and the hillside runs to both sides to get to the nearest convenience store. It takes 3 hours to get to our house, and it takes 5 hours to drive a Ferrari and 5 hours to drive a Mercedes.
Sleeping at night is even more pitiful. Once I had a urgency to urinate and accidentally urinated on my bed. Because my bed was too big, I had to buy a small sheep and put it where I slept. I could ride a motorcycle to urinate at night.
Every month, I have to set fire to my house to burn the money, and use explosives when necessary; every time I think of my rough past, my tears can't help but flow out of the frame......
