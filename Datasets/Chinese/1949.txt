A drunk man went to the hospital to see a doctor.
"I'm sorry..." the doctor finally said, "I can't find out the reason for your discomfort at the moment... It's probably caused by alcoholism."
The drunk man nodded sympathetically, "I understand very well, doctor, wait a few days for you to wake up a bit, and I'll come back."
