An old man is sitting in a rocking chair in front of the door, and a woman comes over
"You look very happy, do you have any secrets to longevity and happiness?"
"I smoke three packs of cigarettes a day, drink a case of beer a week, eat high-fat foods, and never exercise."
"It's amazing, how old are you?"
"Thirty-six"
