Why do many foreigners like to be named "Johnny, Jimmy, Charlie"? In other words - Confucius, Du Fu and Han Yu were invited to present the Nobel Prize for Literature.
In order to take into account the international etiquette, Confucius needed a box of business cards with English names. He told the owner of the printing factory: "Just print Confucius (Confucius)!"
Boss: "That's the honorary title foreigners give to you. You can't call yourself Confucius. I suggest you use your name as your name, because Du Fu came here yesterday. He originally wanted to print Du Fu. I said it was like "tofu". I said like 'confused'."
Confucius: "What happened after that?"
Boss: "Later I told Du Fu, isn't your watch name 'Zi Mei'? Just print Jimmy Du! He is very satisfied. Your old watch name Zhongni, just print Johnny Kong!"
Confucius: "Wonderful!"
The next day Han Yu also went to print his business card, he wanted to print Han Yu, the boss said something like "Hang You! (Hang You!)" Han Yu was going to print it as YuHan, the boss said it was even worse, like "Go hang yourself! ( You Hang!)‚Äù.
Finally, the boss thought that Han's hometown was in Changli, and printed "Charlie Han" to solve the problem.
A few years later, foreigners named them "Johnny, Jimmy, and Charlie" because of their admiration for the three.
