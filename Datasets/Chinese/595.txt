A man found a lamp when he was dying of thirst after getting lost in the desert
After rubbing the lamp, a genie ran out of it
The elf said, "Thank you for saving me. I can give you three wishes"
So he made three wishes
1. I'm dying of thirst! Give me an endless supply of water to drink
2. I want to get out of here I want to go home
3. I haven't seen a woman for a long time, I want to see a woman's ass

The magic lamp elf agreed...and started chanting the spell
squeak

That man became the toilet at home....toilet!
