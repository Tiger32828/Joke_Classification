Daming just got married. One night, my wife was busy with dinner in the kitchen.
In order to be considerate of his wife, Daming wants to help her with some housework. So he said to his dear wife, "Wife, can I help?"
The wife said, "Seeing how clumsy you are, find something simple and just peel the onion." Daming thought this was too simple. However, not long after the peeling, Daming was choked with snot and tears. I thought, this is not an easy task, and I was embarrassed to ask my wife for advice, so I had to call my mother for help.
Mom said, "It's easy, you can't peel it in the water."
So Daming completed his wife's task according to his mother's method, and he was extremely happy.
The next day, Daming called his mother and said, "Mom, your method is really good, but it's good, but the fly in the ointment is that you need to breathe every now and then, it's so tiring."
