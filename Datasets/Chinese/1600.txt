On a humid afternoon, in the quiet library, Ad K felt a little tired after reading books all morning, so he stretched and accidentally bumped into the girl next to him.
The girl was startled! He knocked over the drink on the table and got a lot of clothes wet.
Ade was very embarrassed, and immediately apologized to the girl: "Miss! I'm sorry! You were shocked! I will take responsibility."
The girl turned her head and said to Ade, "Classmate! A little common sense, okay! You just touched me, I can't be "fertilized", but you got me wet, you'd better get toilet paper as soon as possible I'll wipe it!"
