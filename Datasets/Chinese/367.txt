A big boss of a construction company passed away.
When he reported to the underworld, the king of hell asked him, "Do you want to go to heaven or hell?"
The builder said, "Can I visit first?"
Yama: "Of course you can. Well, let's you visit heaven on the first day, hell on the second day, and on the third day I'll ask you whether you want to go to heaven or hell."

Finally, on the third day, King Yama asked the builders, "How do you decide?"
Builder: "Heaven is really beautiful, but there are few people and it is deserted; not only is there a lot of people in hell, but I also saw a lot of friends who were traveling with me, all singing, drinking, chatting, and escorting hot girls, so I decided to go to hell."

As a result, the builder was immediately assigned to hell, but as soon as he reported, he was tortured by going up a mountain of knives and down a frying pan.
The builder suffered a lot of grievances after being tortured, and complained to the King of Hell: "Why is the scene I saw when I visited hell completely different from the truth?"
Hades: "You are a builder and still don't understand the situation. You visited the "sample house" in hell that day."
