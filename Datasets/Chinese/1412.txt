A certain lady is unwell.
Doctor: Miss, congratulations! You are pregnant, and congratulations to your husband, he is going to be a father!
Miss: Huh? I don't have Mr....
Doctor: Then congratulations to your boyfriend! Even if you don't let him be held accountable!
Miss: But they don't have a boyfriend either...
Doctor: Then go back and tell your parents that the second Jesus is about to be born!
