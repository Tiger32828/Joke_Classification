One day, a foreigner traveled to Hong Kong and happened to meet the Dragon Boat Festival.
In the spirit of hospitality, Hong Kong people took foreigners to the beach to watch dragon boating programs.
After reading it, Hong Kong people sent two meat dumplings for foreigners to take back to eat.
A week later, a foreigner sent a letter thanking the Hong Kong people for their hospitality, and wrote: "The meat dumplings are delicious, but unfortunately, the lettuce is a bit tough!"
