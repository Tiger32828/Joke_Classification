During the construction of a building in the Western District, it was said that a girl accidentally fell into a concrete pool and was buried alive.
After the building was built, there were often bursts of crying. One day, Mr. Li, who lived on the third floor, vaguely heard a weeping sound coming from the wall.
Due to the continuous crying, Mr. Li was afraid and couldn't sleep, so he couldn't help but use a chisel and a hammer to chisel the wall.
First, he saw one eye; then chiseled, and the other eye appeared; then he saw the nose and the mouth respectively;
At this time, the mouth suddenly said: "Sir, why did you cut through the wall of my house in the middle of the night?"
