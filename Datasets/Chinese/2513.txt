There was a young psychologist who had his first day as a teacher.
In order to let the principal who was sitting on the sidelines know her talent, she asked the elementary school students a psychological question: "Hello everyone! If you think you are an idiot, please stand up."

The teacher asked him with a smile: "Little boy, do you think you are an idiot?"
Xiaodoudou replied, "Of course not, but I really can't bear to see you standing there for so long..."
