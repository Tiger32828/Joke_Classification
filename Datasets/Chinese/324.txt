The elder brother's child was scolded by the elder sister-in-law for being a stupid bird because of his poor test scores.
The child was unconvinced and said that there are three kinds of stupid birds in the world.
One is to fly first, and the other is too tired to fly.
Sister-in-law asked: What about the third type?
The child said angrily: This is the most hateful kind. If you can't fly by yourself, you will lay eggs in the nest and ask the next generation to fly hard.
