Socrates, the great Greek philosopher, was walking with a friend in Athens one day when a cynic hit him with a stick and ran away.
When his friend saw it, he immediately turned around to find the man to settle the account.
But Socrates stopped him, and the friend asked curiously, "Are you afraid of this man?"
Socrates smiled and said, "You're confused, do you want to pay back a donkey that kicks you?"
