Husband: "Hey! Wife! I think Mrs. Wang next door really hates Le. Every time she comes to borrow vinegar, her excuse is to eat crabs."
Wife: "Just plain! We must find a way! Don't let her be too arrogant."
Husband: "Yes!! Find a way..."
Wife: "Ah, I figured it out! We told Mrs. Wang that we would be more jealous today and asked her to borrow us some crabs."
