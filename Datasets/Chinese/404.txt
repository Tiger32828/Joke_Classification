C flight attendants have always been known for their beauty, while E flight attendants are mainly friendly, and their appearance is not very good.

The two airlines often compete in secret, and even the flight attendants disagree.
One day, after a flight of Air C finished its mission, a row of bright and beautiful flight attendants of C pulled a small suitcase through the airport hall.
Just in front of them was a group of E flight attendants in green uniforms who were also sitting on chairs to rest.
The opponent was very jealous when they met. When passing by E flight attendant, C flight attendant said a word disdainfully: "Hmph, it's ugly~"
Unexpectedly, flight attendant E, although not amazing in appearance, can speak clearly, and immediately replied: "Hmph~ It's better to be ugly than to fall to death!"
The flight attendant C was furious when she heard this, thinking that I am not a fuel-efficient lamp! However, maintaining an elegant temperament, he immediately said:
"Falling to death is a temporary thing. Ugly death is a lifetime thing!"
