One day, the teacher gave Xiao Ming the test paper and asked Xiao Ming to take it home and sign it for his father.
The next day, the teacher asked Xiao Ming, "What did your father say?"
Xiao Ming: "Teacher, do you want to remove the "swear words" part?"
Teacher: "Of course."
Xiao Ming: "He didn't say a word."
