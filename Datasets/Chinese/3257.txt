Alan catches the last minibus home every night after work. She mostly sits in the last row and falls asleep unknowingly.
One day, she fell asleep in the minibus as usual. When she woke up, she found that the car was in the tunnel of the city gate, so she continued to sleep.
After a while, she woke up and found that the car was still in the city gate tunnel. She started to get a little nervous, but she thought that she was too tired and confused, so she continued to sleep.
After an unknown period of time, she woke up again, the car was still in the city gate tunnel and there was only an old woman in the car, and even the driver was gone, she was very scared.
At this time, the old woman looked at her and said, "Young man, everyone is going to push the cart, why are you still here?"
