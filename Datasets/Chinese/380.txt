A dude bought a New Mercedes and hit the highway to celebrate.
When the stopwatch jumped to 130 kilometers per hour, he suddenly found the police car flashing red and blue lights behind him.
He thought to himself, "How can a police car catch up to a Mercedes?"
So he stepped on the accelerator until it hit 150, 160, but he finally stopped the car obediently.
The policeman came up to him and told him, "If you can come up with a reason for racing that I haven't heard of, I'll let you go."
The dude replied, "My wife ran away with the police last week, and I'm afraid you're going to give her back to me..."
