There is a penguin whose home is very far from the polar bear's home. If he walks, it will take 20 years to get there.
One day, the penguin was very bored at home and was going to play with the polar bear. He went out with him, but halfway through the road, he found that he forgot to lock the door. It has been 10 years since he walked, but the door is still Gotta lock it, so Penguin went home and locked the door again.
After locking the door, the penguin set off again to find the polar bear, which means that it took him 40 years to arrive at the polar bear's house...
Then the penguin knocked on the door and said, "Polar bear, polar bear, the penguin is here to play with you!"
After the polar bear opened the door, guess what he said? "Let's go to your house to play~"
