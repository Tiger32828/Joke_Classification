A boy has a crush on a girl for a long time.

One day in the self-study class, the boy finally mustered up the courage to write a note to the girl, which said: Actually, I have been paying attention to you for a long time.

After a while, the note came back with the words: Please don't tell the teacher, I promise I will never eat melon seeds in class again!
