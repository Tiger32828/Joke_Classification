A self-professed teacher, but only recognized the word "Chuan". Seeing the students handing over a book, he planned to find a word for "Chuan" to teach him.
After turning a few pages, I suddenly saw the word "three", and pointed at it and cursed, "I can't find you anywhere, but I lie here and sleep late!"
