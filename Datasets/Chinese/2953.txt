Tom Howard was taller than his father when he was 17.
Whenever he wanted to go out with his friends, he borrowed Mr. Howard's clothes.
Mr Howard gets angry every time he finds his son wearing his clothes.
One evening, as Tom was walking downstairs to go out, Mr. Howard stopped him in the living room.
He looked up and down Tom's clothes, and said angrily, "Your tie is mine, Tom?"
"Yes, Dad, it's yours," Tom replied.
"Isn't that shirt mine too?" he
Dad asked.
"Yes, the shirt is yours too," Tom replied.
"And you're wearing my belt!" said Mr. Howard angrily.
"Yes, I'm wearing your belt, Dad," Tom replied, "you wouldn't want your pants to fall, would you?"
