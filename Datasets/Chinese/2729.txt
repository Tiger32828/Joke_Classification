Two people who were afraid of their wives got together, A complained to B and said, "My wife has been more ruthless than before, and even asked me to carry the toilet."
B touched his neck and said with a stern face: "You are too rude, if it were me——"
Before he finished speaking, B's wife suddenly shouted from behind: "If it were you, what would you do?"
B was so frightened that he immediately knelt down and said, "If it were me, I would have carried it already."
