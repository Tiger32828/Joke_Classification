My sister is an active little girl. She often climbs trees with the little boys, and she always comes back dirty.
One day, my mother finally couldn't bear it anymore and told her sister, "Sister, you can't climb trees in the future, so that those stinky boys will see your cute little pants!"

The next day, my sister still crawled dirty and came back. My sister glanced at her mother who was about to get angry.
He quickly said, "I didn't show those stinky boys the panties!"
"Because I took off my panties and hid them in my pockets when I was climbing a tree!"
