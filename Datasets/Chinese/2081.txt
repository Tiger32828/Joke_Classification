Xiao Ming has always had little confidence in his IQ.
One day, a doctor came to Xiaoming's school to find a bright student, and he volunteered to interview.
The doctor asked Xiao Ming the first question: "Is the earth round?"
Xiao Ming: "Yes!"
Doctor: "How do you know?"
Xiao Ming: "I look at the globe!"
"Yeah." I don't know if this answer is right or wrong,
The doctor asked Xiao Ming a second question: "How big is the universe?"
Xiao Ming: "As big as you say!"
"..." The doctor looked like he was defeated and fell into deep thought.
Xiao Ming passed two levels, and gradually became self-assured: "Doctor, please ask another question!"
"Why do people live?" The Doctor asked a religious philosophical question.
Xiao Ming: "Because people haven't died yet!"
As a result, the doctor hit the wall on the spot, and Xiao Ming became a genius of Dr. Zhuo. All the students in the school lifted Xiao Ming up and circled the playground to celebrate!
