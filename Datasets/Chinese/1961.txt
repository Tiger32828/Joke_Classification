I remember that the regulation of wearing a helmet when riding a motorcycle was just implemented, otherwise it would be fined.
I once saw a very funny thing with my own eyes at the crossroads!
There was a traffic policeman who caught someone without a helmet at the intersection. He quickly saw an old man without a helmet and put him down.
The policeman said, "Old man! Beibei! Don't you know that you will be fined for riding a motorcycle without a helmet?"
The old man said, "Why do I have to wear a helmet! When I was fighting the '823 Artillery War', I couldn't live without a helmet. Why do I have to wear a helmet when I ride a motorcycle now!"
The policeman said, "Cannonballs don't have eyes, but I have eyes!"
