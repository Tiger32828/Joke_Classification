There is a plane, and the passengers on it are some important legislators except for a primary school student.

The plane crashed shortly after takeoff, and it may crash soon,
The people on the plane had to use parachutes to escape, but they found that there were just not enough parachutes on the plane, so the committee members rushed to the parachute to escape, and in the end, only the pilot and the primary school student were left on the plane, so The pilot said to the elementary school student, "You will use the remaining parachute. I will live and die with the plane..."
The primary school student said, "No, there are still two parachutes. An uncle just jumped off with my schoolbag on his back."
