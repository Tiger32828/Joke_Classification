Three sons who had left home and ventured into the world gathered together to discuss the gifts they gave to their mother.

The eldest son said, "I built a big house for my mother."
"I gave her a Mercedes with a driver," said the second son.
The third son said, "I will definitely beat you. You know that mother likes to read the Bible very much, and you should also know that her eyes are not good. I gave her a brown parrot who can read the whole Bible. In total, I spent twenty A monk from a monastery spent 12 years teaching this parrot, and I had to donate 100,000 yuan a year for them to train it. But it was worth it, as long as my mother said the name of the chapter, then The parrot would start reciting the Bible to her."

The story is not over yet!

Not long after, they received a thank you card from their mother:
To the eldest son: "Charles, the house you built is huge. I only live in one room, but I have to clean the whole house.
The letter to my second son said, "James, I'm too old to travel. I'm at home all day, so I've never been in that Mercedes. Also, the driver is so rude and rude!"

Her letter to the third son was much softer: "Dearest Thomas, you are the only one of the three sons who knows what mother likes the most. Thank you for that chicken. It's very delicious."
