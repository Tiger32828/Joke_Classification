When Gandhi was studying law at the University of London, a white professor named Peter hated him extremely.

One day, when Professor Peter was having lunch in the dining hall, Gandhi sat next to him with his plate.
The professor said, "Mr Gandhi, you don't understand that a pig and a bird cannot sit and eat together."
Gandhi looked at him the way a parent would give a rude child, and replied calmly, "You don't have to worry about the professor, I'll fly away."
Peter turned red with anger and decided to take revenge.

The next day, he asked in his room, "Mr. Gandhi, if you were walking down the street and found a package with a bag of wisdom and another bag of money, which bag would you take?"
Gandhi Hao replied without hesitation: "Of course take the bag with the money!"
Professor Peter sneered and said, "If I were you, I would take the bag of wisdom!"
Gandhi responded with a shrug: "Everyone should take what he doesn't have!"

Professor Peter was completely incapable of fighting back, and in a fit of rage, he wrote "idiot" on Gandhi's exam paper and handed it back to Gandhi.
After Gandhi got the test paper, he sat back on the table and tried his best to restrain and remain calm, while thinking very seriously about his next move.
After a few minutes, Gandhi walked up to the professor and responded in a stern and polite tone:
"Professor Peter, you signed my test paper, but you didn't grade me!"
