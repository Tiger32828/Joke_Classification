In a certain university library, Azhu's eyes suddenly lit up and saw a book called "Dream Leftovers on the Grassland", and borrowed it home to read on a whim.
But she flipped through the whole book, and the content had nothing to do with the title, and she complained to the librarian when she returned the book.
Azhu: "This book of yours is just selling dog meat with a sheep's head. It doesn't even talk about why the "wet dreams" landed on the grassland."
Librarian: "Miss, you are wrong, the title of this book is "Dream, Left on the Grassland""
Azhu was greatly disappointed and said very unhappily, "In the future, I will publish a book called "The Moon Often Hangs in the Sky".
The librarian replied: "Very good! Your second book can be called "Dick Can't Spread Its Wings", "Lazy Teaches You Creative Thinking""
