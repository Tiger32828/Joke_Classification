One day, when Xiaozhen was playing with the neighbor's children, she suddenly injured her right leg and ran home with blood dripping!
Mom: "Oops! What's the matter?"
Xiaozhen: "I fell and hurt my right leg!"
Mom: "Does it hurt?"
Xiaozhen: "It hurts!"
Mom: "Yo! Baby! Did you cry when you fell?"
Xiaozhen: "I didn't cry!" After a pause, she said, "Mother isn't there, who should I cry for?"
