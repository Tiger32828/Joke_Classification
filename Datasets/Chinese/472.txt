There was an engineer who reported to heaven after his death.
The gatekeeper of heaven looked at his file and said, "You are in the wrong place. All engineers should report to hell."
Although he didn't feel right, he still went to hell to report.
After living in hell for a few days, he felt that the temperature in hell was too hot, and it was quite uncomfortable to live in, so he designed an air-conditioning system to make hell no longer hot.
After a while, he felt that the transportation system in hell was inconvenient, so he designed another MRT system.
Then he felt that life in hell was too boring, so he designed TV and the Internet.
So the standard of living in hell has become quite comfortable after his improvement.
