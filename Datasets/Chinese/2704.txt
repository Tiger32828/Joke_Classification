In a grand international cocktail party, after three rounds of drinking, the people at the same table talked about the topic of being afraid of wives.
"Which one in this room is most afraid of his wife?" a bald gentleman asked first.
No one said a word, but a monk interjected: "The old monk is afraid of guilt." Just as everyone was surprised, the monk added calmly: "It is precisely because I am afraid of guilt that I dare not marry a wife."
