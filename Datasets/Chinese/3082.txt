Philosopher Diogenes, the banker's son, gave up his fortune,
Bask in the sun in a large wooden barrel, catch bugs, and ponder philosophical questions.
When the Macedonian king Alexander the Great came to the city of Corinth, he visited the philosopher,
And said to him, "Sir, as long as you tell me what you need, I will give it to you right away."
Hearing this, Diogenes lay in the barrel, raised his eyelids, and said, "Then please stand aside, don't block my sunlight."
Alexander said to those around him: If there is an afterlife, I am willing to be Diogenes.
