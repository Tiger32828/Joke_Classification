About: National Philosophy of Play

The Japanese like to play "Go": all problems are considered from the overall situation, and the part is sacrificed for the overall situation, and the sacrificed part is also honored
Americans like to play "bridge": cooperate with their partners tacitly, pay attention to teamwork, and defeat their opponents with purpose
Chinese people like to play "mahjong": guard against the opponent, stare at the upper house, get stuck in the next house, and can't be fooled by oneself... others can't be fooled
