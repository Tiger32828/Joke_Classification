There is a boy in our class who likes to listen to music with headphones on, and hear the emotional part...
Accidentally sang: "Ah, give me a cup of forgetful water, let me not cry all night"
At this time, the math teacher shouted loudly, "Who sang the song?"
The students answered in unison, "Andy Lau."
The math teacher said solemnly, "Andy Lau stayed after school to write as a punishment."
