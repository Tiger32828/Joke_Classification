The last time I went to a restaurant for dinner, I talked to my friends about shooting a short film.
My friend insisted on making a 30-minute film, and I insisted on 10 minutes.
I started to get excited as I talked, I stood up and slapped the table, shouting, "What's wrong with being short? What's wrong with being short? This thing depends on technology!"
Then I felt pity from everyone around me...
