Aunt Chen got into the air-conditioned car and invested a dollar.
The driver said: "Two dollars"
Aunt said: "Yes, it's cool"
The driver said, "Two dollars for an air-conditioned car!"
Aunt replied: "air-conditioned cars are cool"
The driver said, "Two dollars!"
The aunt smiled and said, "Not only is my head cool, but my whole body is cool." After speaking, she walked back.
The driver said, "I told you to put in two dollars"
The aunt said: "I think it's cooler if there are fewer people behind"
The driver was speechless, and the whole car fell in laughter!
