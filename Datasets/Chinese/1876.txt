Dear Son:
I'm writing this letter very slowly because I know you don't read fast
(What does the slowness of your writing have to do with how fast others read it @_@)

We've moved, but the address hasn't changed because we brought the house number with us.
(God, you are so talented, who knows where you moved to -_-)

It rained twice this week, the first time it rained for three days, the second time it rained for four days
(Isn't that equal to raining for a week @_@)

Yesterday we went to buy pizza and the clerk asked: Would you like to cut into 8 slices or 12 slices?
Your thrifty grandmother said: Cut it into 8 slices, but if you cut it into 12 slices, I'm afraid you won't be able to eat it all!
(Aren't they all the same size @_@)

That restaurant's pizza is pretty good. Another day, our family will go to the restaurant in the street to eat steak.
(Is there a logical relationship between the pizza shop and you going to eat steak @_@)

And the coat that your aunt said you wanted me to send, because it would be overweight when mailed, so we cut the buttons and put them in the coat pocket.
(Do you think this would be lighter?)

Your sister gave birth this morning, because I still don't know if it's male or female, so I don't know if you're going to be an aunt or an uncle.
(Any male aunts?)

Mom has nothing to do lately, I will write to you again.

ps. We were going to send you money, but the envelope was already glued
(The envelope is glued? Then how did you type the last paragraph?_?)
