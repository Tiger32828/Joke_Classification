Xiaoshu and Ayu have also argued about recent news reports that the divorce rate in Western countries is far higher than in Taiwan.
Xiaoshu: "I don't think this news is accurate at all!"
Ayu: "I think it's very reasonable!"
Xiaoshu: "How do you say?"
Ayu: "Think about it, the God of Eros in the Western world is just a child, with no hair on his lips and can't handle affairs, so the divorce rate is of course high! Take our God of Eros in Taiwan as an example, we all rely on the old man under the moon, this light The seniority is longer than others in the Western world, and of course marriage is more reliable than them!"
