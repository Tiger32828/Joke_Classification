The Chinese teacher asked: What is the second line of "rich, self-willed"?
Xiao Ming replied: "No money, accept your fate" The teacher was dumbfounded.
The second lesson, the history teacher: "Why did ancient women bind their feet?"
The whole class was lost in thought.
Xiao Ming said loudly, "I'm afraid they will go shopping."
The teacher then asked, "Then why don't you bind your feet now?"
Xiao Ming continued to answer: "Now that there is online shopping, it is useless to bind feet."
Teacher: "Come, come, little brat, come and teach."
