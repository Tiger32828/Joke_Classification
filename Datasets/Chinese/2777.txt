Jia Huatuo, the thief and the prostitute met the King of Hell after their death, and the King of Hell asked what they had done during their lifetime.
Jiahuatuo said, "A villain who practices medicine can bring back the dead when they are sick."
The King of Hell was furious: "I often send ghosts to catch people and shoot more empty cannons. It's actually a good life for you, a dead ghost! Pull it out of the frying pan!"
When I asked the prostitute the next time, the prostitute replied, "If you are hungry and thirsty without a wife, the young ones will satisfy their hunger and thirst."
The King of Yama said, "It is convenient to be alone and prolong one's life."
When I asked the thief again, the thief replied, "I'm a thief. Someone hangs the clothes and distributes the money, and the little one cleans up for him." The King of Hell had a happy expression on his face.
Jia Huatuo shouted anxiously, "If Your Majesty judges this way, just let me return to Yang. There is still a son and a daughter in the family. The son asks him to be a thief, and the daughter asks her to pick up the guest."
