Hitchcock is an internationally renowned film director. When shooting a blockbuster movie, the heroine who worked with him was a big star.
From the beginning of the filming, the female star has been nagging non-stop, one moment she suggested that the shooting angle was wrong, and another moment she asked for a close-up and so on.
In short, she kept reminding Hitchcock to choose her shots from her "best side", telling him several times:
"You must meet my demands!" Hitchcock replied. "I'm sorry! I can't." "Why?"
"Because your best side is in your chair!" Hitchcock exclaimed.
