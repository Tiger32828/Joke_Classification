I went to the bank to transfer money at noon yesterday, drew the number card, and sat waiting for the number to be called.
I found that the lady on the side was talking about the volume of the mobile phone is really not low.

After listening to her finish a phone call, she made another call.
Suddenly, she shouted into the phone: "Chairman, I'm contraceptive! Do you want to come to me tonight!?"
The gazes of the people around her were involuntarily projected on her.
And when I was admiring this lady for her courage to publicize her private itinerary...

Out of the corner of her eye, she saw that the remitter on her remittance slip had the words "Wang Biyun" written on it! !
