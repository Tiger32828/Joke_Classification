It's stupid for a rich man to have a son. One day the rich man took his son to visit the factory.

The rich man: "Son, although you are stupid, it doesn't matter. Dad's factory is fully automated. You see the live pigs enter the machine and the sausages run out one by one. In the future, I will even be dead. , you can still sit back and relax."
Son: "That's amazing, the sausages should go in from this side and the pigs run out from the other side, so that you can sit back and relax."
When the rich man heard this, he was furious, and slapped him down, saying, "I was a sausage in the first place, and I gave birth to your pig."
