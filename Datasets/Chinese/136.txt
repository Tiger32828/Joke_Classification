One day, a vacuum cleaner salesman went to the door of a house and rushed into his house, spilling cow dung on the ground.
The salesman said, "Don't worry, miss, our vacuum cleaner will definitely clean him up, and if it fails, I'll eat him."
I saw the hostess walked into the kitchen and took out soy sauce and ketchup and said: which one do you want to add. "
The salesman was surprised and said, "I haven't smoked yet, how do you know if you can?"
The hostess said, "You can try it, but we just moved in and there is no electricity."
