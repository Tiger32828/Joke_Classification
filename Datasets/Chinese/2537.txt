When Stalin got up in the morning, he heard the sun say, "Mr Stalin, morning!"
Stalin was very happy and thought to himself, "The sun has begun to greet me too!"
At noon, when Stalin was eating lunch, he heard the sun again: "Mr. Stalin, good afternoon!"
Stalin thought: "I have finally won the sun's approval..."
In the evening, Stalin waited, but could not wait for the sun to greet him——
He finally asked, "Hey! Why didn't you say hello to me?"
The sun said, "I have already arrived in the west!"
