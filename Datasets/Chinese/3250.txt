Yazhen went to visit the computer exhibition, when she went to the booth of 3M, a world-renowned manufacturer,

A: "This family must be a liar."
B: "How do you know?"
A: "The capacity of the disk is obviously only 1.2M or 1.44M, so how come 3M?"
Just as Yaling was about to speak, another child next door said, "Dad, do you really have a three-meter-long disk?"
