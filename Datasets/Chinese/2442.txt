Once, Queen Anna of England visited the famous Greenwich Observatory, when she knew that the director of the observatory, the astronomer James Bradley, had a very low salary, and expressed that he would raise his salary.
Bradley, however, begged her not to, saying, "Once this position brings in a lot of money, it's not going to be an astronomer anymore."
