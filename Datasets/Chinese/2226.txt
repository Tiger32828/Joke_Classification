Ah Hua remarried eight times but failed, and then she didn't marry again.
Relatives and friends asked, "Why didn't she try to marry for the ninth time?"
Ah Hua said: "The government strictly prohibits nine marriages, and I am afraid that I will not be able to wear a bra for the rest of my life."
Because the government has a penalty rule: "Nine marriages result in death, and the hood will be hung for life."
