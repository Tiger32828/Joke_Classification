A beautiful young woman walked into a photo studio and said, "Can you enlarge the picture of your husband? And take off the hat on her head."
"Okay!" said the photographer, "but please tell me where his hair is parted?"
"Oh! I don't remember exactly, but you can see if you just take the hat off," she said.
