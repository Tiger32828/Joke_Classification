At 3am last night, the phone rang.
A friend called: "My car was stolen."
I replied drowsily, "Then you should call the police first."
A friend said, "Although it's not a valuable thing, the steering wheel, accelerator, and brake have all been removed. Come and pick me up~"
I thought to myself, how come thieves are stealing everything now.

I quickly put on my coat and went downstairs. Just after I went out, my friend called again: "You don't need to use it. Damn, I just drank too much. So I sat in the passenger seat."
