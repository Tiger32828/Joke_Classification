The chick asked the hen, "Why do humans have names and we are all called chickens?"
The hen replied, "People have names when they are alive, but when they die, they are all called ghosts. Although our chickens have no names when they are alive, they have many names when they die."
The chick asked happily, "What's your name?"
The hen replied: "Fried chicken, curry chicken, white chopped chicken, roast chicken, roast chicken, mushroom chicken, Tuyao chicken..."
