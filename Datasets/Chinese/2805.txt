The father asked his three-year-old son Xiao Tingguang, "Dad and mother, who do you love the most?"
"Love both!"
Dad thought to himself that he would not dare to offend anyone, and let me ask in another way.
"Now Dad is going to Disneyland and Mom is shopping in Paris, where are you going?"
"I'm going to Paris!"
"Why?"
"Because it's more beautiful there!"
"So now dad goes to Paris and mom goes to Disney?"
"Go to Disney of course!"
"why?"
"Because I've been to Paris just now!"
