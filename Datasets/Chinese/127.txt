Once upon a time, an American visited Russia. One day I saw two Russian workers on the road in Russia, one was digging a hole beside the road with a shovel, and he was digging a hole every three meters.
Another worker immediately backfilled the hole just dug by the previous worker, and so on and so forth...,
The Americans were curious and asked the first Russian worker, "Why did the guy behind fill up the hole as soon as you dig it?"
The Russian worker replied, "We are greening the road. I dig holes, plant trees for the second, and fill the soil for the third. Today, the second one didn't come to ask for leave."
