An old woman keeps a pair of parrots for company, but she can't figure out which is the male? Which is only female?
So I called the veterinarian for advice.
The veterinarian advises, "Just watch their mating behavior and the one that rides on it is the male. Then you mark the male's body so you don't get confused."
In the early morning of the next day, according to the veterinarian's instructions, when the parrots mate, she put a white tape on the neck of the male parrot to show the difference.
In the afternoon, the pastor of the church came to be a guest.
When the parrot saw the white collar on the priest's robe, it exclaimed, "Oh! I know what you've done, and you've been marked."
