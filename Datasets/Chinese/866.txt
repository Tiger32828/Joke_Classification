A man went to a bookstore to buy a book and asked, "Where is "Happy Married Life"?"
The clerk said, "This book is a fantasy novel, and it's in the first row."

The man asked again, "What about "The Way of Husband and Wife"?"
The clerk said, "This book is a martial arts novel, and it's in the second row."

Man: "What about "The Essentials of Financial Management and Buying a House"?"
Shop clerk: "That's delusional syndrome. It's a mental illness. It's in the eighth row."

Man: "Where are the books like "How to Get Promoted", "Wage Raise", and "Wage Raise"?"
Shop clerk: "In the judicial crime category, the last row..."

Man: "Do you have a book called "A Man Should Be the Head of the House"?"
The clerk smiled and said, "We don't sell fairy tale books here."
