The uncle went to visit the tomb and sighed: "The paper money is made the same as the real thing, and it was a little distressing when it was burned."
After a wry smile, his wife called and said, "Didn't you go to the grave? Why didn't you bring the paper money on the table? Also, where did the 60,000 yuan I just withdraw today go?"
After hearing this, the uncle was dizzy crying at the tomb, and people passing by praised him: "How filial! It's really rare to see such a cry at the tomb."
In the evening, his grandfather gave him a dream: "Grandson, you are really hurtful. The police in the underworld caught me and said I used counterfeit money."
