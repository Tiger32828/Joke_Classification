This is a real thing that actually happened to me...
I woke up early this day and wanted to eat breakfast that I hadn't eaten in a long time
Upon entering the breakfast shop...
See the soy milk sesame fritters and rice balls and fried dumplings...
heart can not help but jump up
I bought a bunch of miscellaneous things and thought about the school to enjoy it slowly~
As a result... I found out that I don't have a plastic bag! !
This is troublesome...
I bought so many in case I don't have a plastic bag, how can I take it with me! ?
The boss saw me a little panicked
He sees through it all...
He opened his mouth slowly...
With his chapped lips without lip balm, he said slowly...
"Young boy~ You didn't bring a plastic bag!?"
I am embarrassed to answer
"Yes~ You really don't have any plastic bags here!?"
The boss smiles...

"You look back slowly now... Did you see that telephone pole!? Wait a minute and walk over there~ there is a place on it
Plastic bags~ It depends on which one you want. Take it yourself~ Don't say that I gave it to you! ! This is what you picked up! ! Found it! ! "
I..."...(Boss... Count on you!!)"
