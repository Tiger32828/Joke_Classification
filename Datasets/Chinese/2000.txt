Xiao Ming has the habit of getting up to pee at night, and has his own pronoun: "singing".
So every time Xiao Ming wants to pee, he tells his parents to sing, and his parents take him to the toilet.
One day Xiaoming's parents went abroad to travel, and they asked Xiaoming's grandfather to come home to be with Xiaoming.
In the middle of the night, Xiao Ming wanted to pee again, so he shook his grandfather up.
Xiao Ming: "Grandpa, I want to sing."
Grandpa: "What song are you singing in the middle of the night, hurry up and go to bed, don't make any noise."
Xiao Ming: "Grandpa, I really want to sing. Without singing, I can't sleep."
Grandpa: "What a bad habit, okay! okay! I let you sing, but singing at such a late hour will disturb others, so just sing softly in Grandpa's ear."
