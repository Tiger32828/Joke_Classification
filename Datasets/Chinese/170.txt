The six-year-old Xiaofang is very cute and is often proposed by the little boys in the class.
One day, Xiaofang came home and said to her mother, "Mummy! Today Xiaoqiang proposed to me and asked me to marry him."
Mom said casually, "Does he have a regular job?"
Xiaofang thought for a while and said, "He is in charge of cleaning the blackboard in our class."
