There is a 40-year-old girl who is growing well, has a job, and has a stable income.
One day Xiao Ming asked her, "You are so good, why haven't you gotten married yet?"
The girl replied, "I was on the track and field team when I was young. I was injured once and left a scar on the sole of my foot."
Xiao Ming asked, "There is a scar on the sole of the foot, what does it have to do with whether you are married or not?"
The girl replied, "Yes! Then what does it matter to you whether I get married or not?"
