On a park bench sat a young and beautiful Mrs. William with a lovely baby in her arms.
A middle-aged gentleman came over.
"What a lovely little girl!" said the gentleman affectionately, taking the baby's hand, "white and tender, like the hand of an attractive lady."
Mrs. William pulled the baby into her arms and said coldly, "Sir, you are mistaken, first, the child is a boy; second, you are holding my hand."
