During the Chinese New Year, everyone uses their mobile phones to send text messages to celebrate the New Year.
During the New Year's Eve, I sent out 32 text messages and received no reply.
On the first day of the first day, I sent another 19 text messages, but still no reply;
In the second day of junior high, I sent 13 messages, but still no reply.
When I finally received a text message in the third year of junior high, I excitedly shouted to my wife, "Look, someone has given me New Year's greetings!"
When I opened my phone, the text message read: "Chunghwa Telecom wishes you a Happy Chinese New Year! By the way, your phone has been shut down due to arrears."
