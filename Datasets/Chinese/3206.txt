There is nothing more profitable than zeal and confidence when it comes to seeking employment.
When I first went to apply for a job, there was only one vacancy, but there were hundreds of applicants waiting.
While waiting, everyone seemed to feel hopeless.
When it was my turn, I asked general questions as usual, and finally asked me when I could go to work if I was hired.
"Oh, I even brought my lunch today," I said eagerly.
I got that position and started working that afternoon.
