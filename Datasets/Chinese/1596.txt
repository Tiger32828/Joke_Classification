Spaniards like beef balls, and after the bullfight is over, they cut off the "testicles" of the bullfighting bull and eat it.
One day, a Spaniard went to a restaurant to order beef balls, and the waiter said, you pay the deposit, and they will be given to you tomorrow.
The next day, this person came to pick up the beef balls and found that the "balls" were very small, so he asked why, and the waiter replied, "Sir, it's not always the bullfight that loses~Today is the bullfighter who lost~"
