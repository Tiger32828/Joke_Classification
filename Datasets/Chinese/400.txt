Chinese old lady talks about situation in South China Seaâ€¦

The old lady said firmly:
"The South China Sea must be ours! Otherwise, where will Guanyin live?
The East China Sea is also ours, otherwise where will the Dragon King live?
Guanyin and Dragon King are only available in China, and no one can take them away!
Suddenly I thought she was right! Thumbs up! "

Then she added:
"The moon should also be ours, otherwise where will Chang'e live?
The sky is ours, otherwise what would the Jade Emperor and the Queen Mother do? "

Regarding the international situation:
The old lady said: "I always negotiate and negotiate, the site of my home,
Own ocean, own sky, what is there to negotiate! Get in and get out.
To fight a war is to use money. There are 1.4 billion people in the country, and 10 yuan per person is 14 billion yuan. If it is not enough to get 100 yuan per person, it will cost more than 100 yuan to play mahjong every day!
Look at such a profound international problem, which was solved by the old lady in one sentence. "

Chinese old lady cow!
