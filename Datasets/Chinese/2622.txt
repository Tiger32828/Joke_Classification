In one exam, the teacher specially allowed students to open the book, but a certain student put the textbook on his lap to copy, and the textbook was heavy and looked like he was struggling.
The teacher couldn't help but ask him, "Student, aren't you tired? Why don't you bring the textbook to the desk and write it?"
Student: "But, I'm used to it."
