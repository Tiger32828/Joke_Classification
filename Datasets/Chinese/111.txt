One day, three archers met to shoot arrows, and the target was the apple on the head of the servant ten feet away. Archer A pulls the bow and shoots long, with a bang, the arrow hits the apple.
A raised his chin arrogantly, showed a thumb and said, "Iam Houyi!"
Not to be outdone, the shooter B also shot the apple. He shouted arrogantly, "Iam Cupid!"
When it was C's turn, he also drew his bow and shot the sharp arrow! The result... hits the heart of the servant.
He stammered for a long time before he spit out a sentence: "I....I....I...am...sorry!"
