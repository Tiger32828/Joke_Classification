A sailor has just returned from the South China Sea and is telling his friends about his thrilling battle with a shark.
He described how he was swimming naked in a small lake when suddenly a large shark came to bite him.
Then he said how he took a small foreign knife out of his trousers pocket and stabbed the shark in the deadly part and killed the monster.
"But you're not wearing clothes, so how can you take out a knife from your pants?" a suspicious person asked.
"You don't want to hear the story at all," cried the angry sailor. "You just want to raise the bar."
