A beautiful woman goes to the dentist.
When I see surgical instruments, I feel terrified. He shouted: "I am most afraid of drilling teeth, I would rather have children than drilling teeth!"
The male dentist said to her impatiently, "I'll do it for you if you want to have a baby or drill your teeth. But you still have to choose the same so that I can adjust the height of the chair!"
