Dad saw his son and his wife begging for 1,000 yuan to buy things,
The daughter-in-law refused to give anything.
The father was very angry when he saw it, and called his son aside and said, "Damn it! You are a dignified man, you don't have 1,000 yuan on your body, and you have to ask your wife hard for it. Can you have a little ambition? Stop begging her! I'll give it to you tonight."
The son asked, "Dad~, why don't you give it to me now?"
Dad said, "How can I have money now~ I'll ask your mother to ask for it at night"
