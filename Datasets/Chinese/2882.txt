A patient who once suffered from mild tuberculosis went to the hospital for an X-ray every three months.
Every time the doctor in charge always looked at the X-rays and said to him, "Very good, this medicine is really effective, you are getting better very quickly!"
In fact, the doctor said the phrase "you're getting better soon" seven or eight times in a row, and it took two years for the patient to fully recover.
