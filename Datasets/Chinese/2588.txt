One day, an elderly couple were chatting.
Wife: "Wife, although we are getting old, we should have a little sex, right?"
The husband was embarrassed when he heard it, and then they started to discuss how often it should be. After a while of haggling, the wife was a little impatient.
At this time, the husband suddenly raised three fingers, the wife's face was very happy, and she said happily, "Three times a day?"
Husband shook his head.
Wife: "Three times a week?"
Husband shook his head.
The wife raised her voice and said, "Is this three times a month? Or once every three months?"
At this time, the husband said slowly, "You can choose these three fingers."
