It was after eleven o'clock last night, when Brother Abiao was doing night patrols in the community before going to bed as usual,
Suddenly I saw a child I had never seen sitting sullenly beside the road,
He walked up to him and asked with concern, "My little one, it's so late, what are you doing sitting outside alone, why don't you go inside to sleep?"
The child pouted and said, "Dad, mommy is still arguing."
When Brother Abiao heard this, he muttered in his heart: "It's ridiculous! It's so late and we're still arguing."
So he asked again, "Who is your father?"


The child answered innocently:
"I don't know either, the two of them are arguing about this issue right now."
