When everyone finally got on the plane, the flight attendant made the following announcement:
"Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry for the delay of everyone's time and for causing everyone to run a lot.
This flight is bound for Washington, if you got on the wrong plane, please leave now. "

After the broadcast, the captain ran out of the cockpit with a flushed face and said:
"Sorry, I got on the wrong plane."
