A warship was sailing at sea. One night, a sailor suddenly noticed that there was a little light in the distance,
He immediately reported to the captain: "Report to the captain, there is a ship heading towards us not far away, if we don't change our course, we will collide!"
When the captain heard this, he immediately called "Call! I'm the captain, please move your ship and the channel 10 degrees east!"
The other party replied: "Call call! Please move 10 degrees west!"
Captain: "I'm a warship, you dare to ask me to move!"
The other party immediately said: "Damn! I'm a lighthouse, you can try it if you have something?"
