The teacher asked Xiaoqiang, "Who burned the Yuanmingyuan?" Xiaoqiang said aggrievedly, "Teacher, I didn't burn it."
"What? You, you, call your father!" the teacher said angrily.
After school, Xiaoqiang's father came, and the teacher said to him:
"Today I asked your son who burned the Yuanmingyuan, and he actually said that he didn't burn it. This is ridiculous, isn't it?"
Xiaoqiang's father blinked and said hesitantly:
"Teacher, really... it wasn't him... who burned it, our children wouldn't do such a thing. Otherwise..., we... lose money. ?"
