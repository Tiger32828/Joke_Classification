Some time ago, I went to the supermarket,
There were two foreign friends at the checkout desk who checked out in front of me.

The clerk asked: "Can you speak Chinese?"
The two foreign friends replied in Chinese: "If you speak slowly, we can understand!"

The clerk continued, "Can...you...speak...Chinese?"
