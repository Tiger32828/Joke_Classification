Once upon a time there was a magistrate who had neither knowledge nor talent, and only flattered.
One day, the magistrate went to the prefect's house for a banquet, and the two of them talked about family affairs at the banquet.
The magistrate asked the prefect: "Sir, how many sons are there?"
The prefect replied, "The two dogs."
The prefect then asked the magistrate, "How many are your magistrates?"
This sentence made the magistrate stumped: "The son of the prefect is still called 'dog', what should I call it?"
After hesitating for a long time, he replied, "Alas! Only a three-year-old son of a bastard!"
