A young lady who lives in Banqiao found that Banqiao Station was not stopping after getting on the Ziqiang train, so she begged the conductor to stop at Banqiao Station, but the conductor said that she could not stop illegally and could only park at Banqiao Station. Slow down and let her jump off.

As a result, when they arrived at Banqiao Station, the train came into the station at a very slow speed. The young lady tried her best to jump down, but due to inertial motion, she jumped off the train and watched the train leave as she ran. . . . . . . . .

At this time, someone suddenly lifted her from behind, pulled her into the car again, and said to her with a smile, "Miss, you are so lucky, this bus doesn't stop at Banqiao Station. You pull up..."
