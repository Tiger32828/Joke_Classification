An energetic old woman went to take the bus. After getting on the bus, a polite boy scout got up to make way for the old woman.
The old woman said, "Good! You sit down, I'm still young, just stand!"
After a while, the boy scout stood up again, and the old woman patted him on the shoulder and said, "It doesn't matter, you don't have to let me sit. I'm not that old, and my stamina is pretty good!"
After two, three, four times like this, the Boy Scouts were crying! The boy scout cried and said, "Old woman, my house has passed several stops, why don't you let me go home!"
