Girlfriend: "Baby, I don't seem to be here this month..."
With a serious face, her boyfriend silently turned behind him, held something in his hand and handed it to his girlfriend.
The girlfriend asked suspiciously, "What is this?"

Boyfriend: "Kinder's Surprise Egg, surprises you (menstrual period) constantly."
