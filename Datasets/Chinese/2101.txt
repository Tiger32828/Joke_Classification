The teenager accidentally overturned the cart, and the cart was full of corn scattered on the road. A farmer who lived nearby came to check.
Farmer: "Don't worry, Serena, don't worry about it for now, come to my house for dinner first! I'll turn the car over for you after dinner."
Serena: "Thank you for your kindness, but I think my father will be unhappy with me doing this."
Farmer: "No, boy, come on!"
Serena: "Okay! But Dad won't be happy."
After the meal, Xiaowei thanked the host: "I feel better now, but I know Dad will be very unhappy."
Farmer: "Don't be silly, by the way, where is your father, I'll tell him."
Serena: "Under the car."
