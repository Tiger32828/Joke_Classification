One of the criminals escaped and ran to the house of a young couple. The criminals tied the couple to a chair and a bed respectively.
Then he pressed it on the young lady, and saw the lady struggling violently and shaking her head desperately. The criminal saw that the lady was not willing to die, so he stood up angrily and walked out.
When the husband saw this, he immediately said to his wife, "Wife, he has been in prison for so long, he will definitely have physical needs, so you have to reluctantly cooperate. This is related to the lives of both of us."
The wife said, "I'm relieved to hear you say this. He just pressed on me and said you were cute. He asked if there was any lubricant in our house. I shook my head desperately and said no. He was very angry and decided to go out and buy it himself."
