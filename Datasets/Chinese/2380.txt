My wife has been depressed and has a bad temper since she became a housewife

One day my husband came back from get off work and saw his wife cooking!

Husband hugs wife from behind

Gently said: dear! What shall we eat tonight?

The wife said fiercely: Jiasai (eat shit)!

My husband was so frustrated that he took the newspaper and went to the toilet...

The wife thought to herself: My husband is also working hard, the attitude just now is really inappropriate!

So, I knocked on the door of the bathroom and said, "Husband! What are you doing!"

The husband said coldly, "I'm making dinner!"
