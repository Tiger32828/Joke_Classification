When I was in elementary school, I was the headmaster for the first time. I was so nervous!
"Buzz..." The class bell rang, and the teacher walked into the classroom slowly. When the teacher was positioned, I shouted nervously, "Stand up!"
At this time, I suddenly heard my brother yelling: "Alas! I just fell asleep, what are you arguing about? Don't go to bed soon, there will be class tomorrow!"
