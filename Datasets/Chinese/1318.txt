One day, there was a frog in the frog country. It had a big tumor on its neck.
It just thought, "Oh, it hurts~ No way! I'm going to see a doctor," and it went to the doctor.
The doctor said to it, "Don't be afraid! Take medicine and it will be fine, but don't touch it (tumor)."
The frog said, "Okay (nod)"
Then, the tumor bursts.
