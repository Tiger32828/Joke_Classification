Grandma and Xiao Ming were sitting together in the living room watching the soprano singing performance on TV. Xiao Ming suddenly pointed to the conductor on the screen and turned to ask grandma, "Grandma, why did the man in black hit the girl with a stick?"
Grandma replied suspiciously, "When did that person hit her?"
Xiao Ming said, "If that person didn't want to hit her, why did the girl scream?"
