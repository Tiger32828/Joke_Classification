There are three ghosts chatting about how they died.

The first said, "I'm dying for nothing.
I used to have a beautiful wife, but I always suspected that she was cuckolding me, so one day I came back soon after leaving home.
My wife was lying on the bed when I broke in, but there was no one else in the room. I was suspicious for a moment and looked around.
Finally, I found a pair of hands gripping the railing of my balcony. I was instantly furious and stomped on those hands desperately.
That bastard finally fell. Unexpectedly, my house lived on the twenty-sixth floor, and he did not die.
I was so angry, and I didn't know where the strength came from, I picked up the refrigerator and smashed it down. Others were smashed to death, and when I remembered that the refrigerator was smashed, I died of anger for no apparent reason. "

The second said, "I'm dying even more incomprehensibly!
My house lives on the 29th floor. One day I was drying my clothes and accidentally dropped it.
But luckily, I grabbed onto the railing of a certain floor.
But just as I was screaming for help, a lunatic stomped on my hand desperately, and I finally fell.
Still, I was lucky that I didn't fall to my death.
However, at this moment, a refrigerator fell from the sky, and I was crushed to death. "

The third sighed and said, "I am the most pitiful.
Although I'm a thief, I shouldn't be dead in the dark.
That day I went to a house to pack some things, but the hostess of the house suddenly woke up from sleep.
I had nowhere to hide, so I had to hide in her refrigerator.
Who would have thought that when I was dizzy from the cold and was about to come out, the refrigerator suddenly flew up, and I died so inexplicably. "
