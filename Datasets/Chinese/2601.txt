in an entrepreneurial meeting.
A brick factory owner said to a food factory owner, "I heard that the cakes made by your factory are harder than our bricks. Can you give us some experience?"
The owner of the food factory hurriedly said, "Don't dare, I was thinking of learning from your factory~ I heard that the bricks made by your factory are even crisper than our walnut cakes!"
