Today, the master came to install the air conditioner. I repeatedly reminded him to be careful and safety first.
He said, "I can't see that you are very cautious at a young age. Don't worry, I will never trouble you if something happens!"
After I finished speaking, I slid down from the windowsill and sat on the cactus that I had raised for five years.
At that moment, the voice-activated lights on the first to fifteenth floors were all on!
