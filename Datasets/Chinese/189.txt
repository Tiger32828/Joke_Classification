A man was sitting on a state-of-the-art luxury jet airliner when he suddenly had a stomachache and had diarrhea, but all the men's toilets were full.
But he couldn't hold it any longer, so he asked the flight attendant to let him use the girls' toilet. The flight attendant was a little embarrassed, but still agreed to let him go.
He was also worried that he would tell him not to touch anything and come out as soon as he had diarrhea, so he hurriedly went into the girls' toilet.

When he finished pulling, he found that there were three buttons next to the toilet, which were written HW, HA, and ATR.
Out of curiosity, he pressed the first HW button.
what! He even sprayed hot water to clean his ass from behind. That's great..Oh...it means Hot Water.
He thought to himself, HA is Hot Air! ...Sure enough, after pressing the button, a warm wind is sent slowly.
So what exactly does ATR mean? .. should be better service! So he pressed the third button.
Sudden sharp pain. Eyes darkened and dizzy. …
When he woke up, he was already in the hospital. The nurse looked at him solemnly.
"Sir. I have your dick in my hand. I put it next to your pillow."
"Wow wow wow... how could this be? Am I not using the toilet? How could this be?"
"Sir, you hit the ATR button by mistake. That's the Automatic Tampon Remover."
