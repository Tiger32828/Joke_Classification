The mother gave the son ten yuan and two bottles and asked him to buy oil for five yuan and vinegar for five yuan. The son came back soon after he went out.
Son: "Which of these two bottles is going to be used for oil? Which one is going to be cool?"
Mom: "Whatever."
The son walked for a while and then turned back.
Son: "Of the ten dollars, which five dollars buy oil, and which five dollars sell vinegar?"
Mom: "Whatever."
The son left, but came back without going out the door.
Son: "After I buy oil and vinegar, which hand do I use to hold the oil and which hand to hold the vinegar?"
