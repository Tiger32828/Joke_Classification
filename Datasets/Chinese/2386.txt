When a guy sends a girl home, because the atmosphere is so good...and it's hard to part...
So I couldn't help but kiss her at the door of the woman's house!
After a while, all the lights upstairs came on.
dong dong dong... her dad came down... opened the door...
With a very bad face, he said, "Boy, you went out with my daughter without my permission, and you brought her back so late... You are still doing this at the door. I don't care about you, but please, please You don't want to press on our doorbell, okay?"
