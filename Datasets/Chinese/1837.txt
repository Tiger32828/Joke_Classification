A and B are good friends who love baseball. They often debate whether there is a baseball team in heaven.
One day, A died unfortunately, and soon after, he reported the dream to B.
A: "I want to tell you good news and bad news."
B: "What good news?"
A: "Heaven really has a baseball team!"
B: "What about the bad news?"
A: "You will be the starting pitcher next Wednesday..."
