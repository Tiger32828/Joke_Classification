Meimei, a freshman in college, once mentioned her father's occupation as an astronomer in a letter.
The letter said: "Dad! You always thought that I didn't pay attention when you told me about the constellations. But I went out with an ordinary friend the other night, and I showed him the Big Dipper and Orion. You must be very happy to know that. ?"
Meimei's father wrote back and said, "I'm really happy. My mother and I went for a walk the other night and saw the Big Dipper, but we didn't see Orion, because Orion doesn't appear until two o'clock in the morning at this time of year. Can you tell me who your normal friend is?
