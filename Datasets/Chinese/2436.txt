Two homeless people were arrested. The judge asked one of them, "Where do you live?"
"There is no home everywhere," he said, waving his arms wide. "Fields, forests, hills, shipwrecks..."
The judge turned to the other homeless man and asked, "Where do you live?"
"Me?" the man said. "I live next door to him."
