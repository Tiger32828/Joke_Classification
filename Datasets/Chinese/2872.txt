A tortoise seller boasted that the tortoise was a ten thousand year tortoise and could live for 10,000 years, but a child died the next day after buying it.
To this end, the angry mother took the child to find the theory of selling turtles.
The tortoise seller replied, "I forgot to tell you that this tortoise lived just 10,000 years as of yesterday."
