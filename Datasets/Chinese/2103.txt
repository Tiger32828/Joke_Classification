A housing agency business manager went to Huanchang to seek pleasure. After the end, the business manager gave the woman 3,000 yuan; while the original agreement was 6,000 yuan, the lady was not willing to be deceived, so she went to the agency the next day to find the manager.
The manager's secretary told the woman, "You must make an appointment to find the manager."
The woman said, "Last night we had an appointment to 'see the house'!" and went straight into the manager's office.
The woman said, "Why did you only give me 3,000 when I said 6,000 yuan last night?"
The manager said, "I gave a deposit, but I'm not satisfied with the "house" so I don't want to pay the balance."
The woman said, "What's your dissatisfaction?"
The manager said, "Your 'house' is too big."
The woman said, "It's because your 'furniture' is too small."
The manager said in dissatisfaction, "Your "house" will leak."
The woman said disdainfully, "It's your "faucet" that doesn't lock tightly."
The manager said angrily, "Your 'house' is too dirty."
The woman said calmly, "My previous 'tenant' just left."
Before you can clean up, you just come in.
