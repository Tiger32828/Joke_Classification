When a couple wants to have sex, they will use "washing clothes" as a code.
One day, after the two couples quarreled and quarreled, because the wife was angry and the husband had sex needs, it was inconvenient to open his mouth to woo his wife, so he had to ask his son to pass the message on his behalf.
Son: "Mom, Dad said his clothes are dirty and he needs to do laundry."
Mom was very angry and said, "Tell your father that the washing machine is broken, and I won't wash it today."
A few days later, this time it was the wife's turn to hold back, so she asked her son to pass the message on her behalf.
Mom: "Go and tell your dad that the washing machine is repaired and you can do laundry."
The son immediately said, "Mom, Dad explained that he has already washed it by himself."
