There is a third-grade student in elementary school. He is very smart, but it is very difficult for him to concentrate on listening to lectures.
One day, when the teacher was halfway through the class, the smart student said, "Teacher, I already understand so much, why should I study again?"
The teacher said, "Really! You're in third grade, so what are you going to do?"
The student said: "The teacher is in the third grade and can teach the second grade students."
