One day, the world will launch the world's most powerful police. At the last stage, there is only one FBI in the United States, KGB in Russia and the police in Taiwan.
The test question is to put a little white rabbit into a large forest, and find the target (little white rabbit) within ten minutes, otherwise it will be eliminated.
First, the FBI went in and launched a carpet-like search. Ten minutes later, the FBI returned without success.
The next one was KGB. As soon as they entered, they set fire to the forest, trying to force out the little white rabbit. Ten minutes later, the effect of burning the forest was unimaginable, and KGB was eliminated.
When it was the Taiwanese policeman's turn, he calmly walked into the forest with the baton in his hand.
In less than five minutes, the Taiwanese police came out with a panda's ear twisted in their hands and brought a panda out.
Just when everyone thought it was strange, Panda said: Don't fight again! Stop fighting! I admit that I am a little white rabbit!
