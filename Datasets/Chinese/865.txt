When Xiao Ming was in middle school, the class stipulated that anyone who swears would be fined five yuan at a time.
One day, Xiaoming said swear words and was overheard by the teacher, and then he would fine Xiaoming five yuan.
After that, Xiao Ming took ten yuan to the teacher.
The teacher said, "I have no money to find you!"
Xiao Ming replied: "Go! Don't look for it!"
