My aunt's child is only that old, and my aunt let him learn this and that. This child is really smart!
My aunt said, "Come on, read to my brother what you've learned. See if you've learned well."
The child began to recite Yiyiyiyi: "What is life...what is it?"
I'm surprised, how old is this? Just started to think about the esoteric question?
The child continued: "Ginseng, is a Chinese herbal medicine!"
