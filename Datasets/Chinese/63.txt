The teacher said, "Don't call yourself "the author" in the future when you speak in the past because no one writes with a pen at all."
The student asked back, "What do you call it?"
The teacher said: "Key person"
The student then asked, "What about the person using the mouse?"
The teacher said: "It's called the rat"
The student asked again, "Then the smart phones are all touch-sensitive. They don't have a disk or a mouse, so what should they be called?"
The teacher said, "It's called touching birth"
