I remember one day, two beautiful beauties came to the company, with delicate skin and sexy clothes.
It's here to sell Yakult.
Our eyes brightened and each asked for a few bottles, and then the beauty said:
"Is there any brother who wants to drink Yakult every day? I can deliver it."
Almost all male colleagues roared in unison: "I want it! I want it!"
Everyone knows that the next day, an amiable old aunt gave us Yakult every day...
Damn, it's been three years.
