A taxi driver wearing sunglasses and chewing betel nut and a priest wearing a robe and holding a cross came to heaven at the same time.
The angel looked through the information and told the priest that he could be allocated a cabin, and told the taxi driver that he could get a luxury villa.
Priest: "I have dedicated my whole life to God and prayed with the people. Why is my treatment inferior to that of a taxi driver?"
Angel: "Because people are praying when this driver is driving, and people are sleeping when you're praying."
