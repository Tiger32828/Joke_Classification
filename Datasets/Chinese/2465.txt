In a modern art exhibition, a person stood in front of a painting, looked at the painting seriously, and said to the painter, "You paint so well, my saliva is drooling when I see it."
The painter asked in surprise, "Why do you drool when you see the sunset?"
The viewer replied, "I thought you painted boiled goose eggs!"
