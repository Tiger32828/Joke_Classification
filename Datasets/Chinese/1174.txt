To the bank to remit, the car temporarily parked on the side of the road. For fear of being fined by the traffic police, I left my friend to look at the car, and told him that a car inspection would come and let me know,

A few minutes later, the traffic police came.
The friend rushed into the bank and shouted loudly:

Brother, the police are here, let's go!
Nima, there were dozens of people in a huge hall, and it was silent for a moment.
Then the crowd flooded the bank like a flood,

Then I was pinned to the ground by five or six security guards...
What a fucking injustice!
Not afraid of god-like opponents, but of pig-like teammates!
