A man bought a parrot and wanted to teach it civilized language.
So every morning when I passed it I said, "Good morning."
It is said that he was not in a good mood this morning, and he didn't say anything when he passed it,
The bird stared at him coldly and said, "Hey, why didn't you greet me today?"
