One day on the happy grassland, the elephant was smoking heroin and the little white rabbit saw it.
The little white rabbit said, "Elephant ~ Elephant ~ drug use is not good for your health, let's run freely on the grassland together!"

When the elephant heard it, he put down the drugs and ran away with the little white rabbit. Running and running, they met the giraffe smoking marijuana.
Little White Rabbit said, "Giraffe ~ giraffe ~ drug use is not good for your health, let's run freely on the grassland together!"
So giraffes joined them.

Running and running, I met a lion who was eating ecstasy,
The little white rabbit said, "Lion ~ lion ~ drug use is not good for your health, let's run freely on the grassland together!"
When the lion heard it, he rushed over and beat him hard.

When the elephant and giraffe saw it, they quickly persuaded him, "The little white rabbit is also for our own good, so why beat him?"
The lion said, "Damn it! This bastard rabbit drags me and runs around like a madman every time he finishes eating the happy pills. He has to teach him a lesson today!"
