Big brother is reluctant to throw anything at home.
I went to his house one day and he was taking a cold shower.
I said, "Brother, are you sick? It's such a cold day, and there's no heating at home. How can you take a cold shower?"
He said something that I will never forget: "There are two packs of cold medicine left at home. If you don't take it, it will expire!
