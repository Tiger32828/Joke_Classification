Xiaoqi was walking on the street and received a call from her boyfriend,
After talking on the phone, a bolt from the blue, she was dumped.

Suppressing her feelings, she walked alone near the Xingtian Palace. Seeing that there was a farewell ceremony at the funeral home in front of her, she chose the largest hall and burst into tears.
All the grief and grievances were vented out.
The memorial service is over, wipe away tears, and are about to leave. Three women came by,

I am the big room, this is the second room, she is the third room, we have discussed it, since you are the unexposed junior four,
I will give you 100 million in cash, other real estate and stocks, without your share, don't make things bigger, do you agree?

Xiaoqi nodded.
Tears are used in the right place and are very valuable.

It is said that many people are going there to treat their brokenheartedness.
