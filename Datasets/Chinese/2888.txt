A little boy came home with an ice cream in each hand, and his mother asked him, "Have you spent all your money?"
"It didn't cost anything," the boy replied.
"Someone invited you?" Mother guessed.
The little boy shook his head.
"You didn't steal it, did you?"
"no."
"Then how did you get the ice cream in your hand?"
"I told the lady that I wanted a chocolate in one hand and a mint in the other. When I got it, I told her she could reach into my pocket and get the money herself; but be careful not to touch to my beloved little snake."
