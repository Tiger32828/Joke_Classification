An alcoholic who became unconscious when he started drinking, called the owner of the hotel at five o'clock in the morning and asked, "What time does the hotel open?"
The boss said, "I'm sorry, but I can't come in until after the afternoon."
The drunk said, "Whoever said I'm going in, I'm going out."
