John, who was still wandering outside at midnight, happened to meet a thief who had just come out of someone else's house.
John grabbed the thief and retrieved from him items such as bras, necklaces, gold rings and diamonds used by the woman.
John asked, "If you can answer me a question, I can let you go. Otherwise I'll take you to the police station."
The thief asked, "What's the problem?"
John: "How did you sneak into the bedroom and take these things without waking the lady?"
