For many years, children only remember Mother's Day, but forget Father's Day, so Dad is quite lost.

On August 8 this year, a father was sitting at the dining table with his family, and suddenly his son went to the refrigerator.

When he opened the refrigerator and squatted down to take something, he suddenly said nonchalantly, "Dad, do you know what month and day it is today?"

The father secretly rejoiced in his heart, thinking that this son might give him a surprise, so he happily replied: "Today is August 8th."

The son was a little disappointed and said, "Wow, the milk is expired!"
