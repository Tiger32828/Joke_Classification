There is a pizzeria that advertises delivery within 30 minutes.
Every time the waiter brings pizza to a guest's house, he always says, "Hello, I'll be there in fifteen minutes. This is the pizza you want." Or "Miss, I'll be there in twenty minutes." I just didn't have more than thirty minutes" of pride.
Once someone ordered pizza delivery, a young boy rang the doorbell within twelve minutes and waited for the door to open.
He said, "Miss, I'll be there in twelve minutes, but I forgot to bring pizza."
