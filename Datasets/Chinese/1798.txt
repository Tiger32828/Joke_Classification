Once in class, I secretly listened to a song, for fear of being discovered by the teacher and hinting at my classmates to cover me.
He pointed to my ear and then to the teacher.
I thought he understood, but I didn't expect him to stand up and say to the teacher, "Teacher, please speak in a low voice. It disturbs my classmates listening to the song."
