During live ammunition training, a soldier failed to hit the bullseye with several shots. The instructor angrily snatched the soldier's gun and said sharply, "Idiot! Look at me."
He aimed to shoot, but the bullet went off the target. He turned aggressively and shouted at the soldier, "Look, that's how you shoot!"
