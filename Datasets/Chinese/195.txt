In the chaos of the army, a cavalryman caught a beautiful nun who was about to hide in the woods.
Later, when he returned to the monastery, he said to the priest, "The wicked man quickly caught me, stripped me of my clothes, and threw me into the haystack... Father, what do you think I should do? manage?"
Priest: "Then eat lemons, and eat them right away."
Sister: "Eat lemons? Why eat lemons?"
Priest: "Wait a minute, isn't there someone coming? It would be bad if your happy face was seen!"
