One day Xiaoming went to a bar for a drink and found three black people sitting next to him.
After three rounds of drinking, Xiao Ming went to the toilet, and it happened that the three of them went to the toilet together.
Xiao Ming glanced at it and was very puzzled. When he returned to the bar,
Xiao Ming asked the waiter, "Did I drink too much alcohol and my eyesight was blurry? I went to the toilet just now and found that of the three black people next to me, the "that" in one of them was white."
Waiter: "You read that right, those three are white, but they work in the mines, so they look black."
"Then why is there only one "that" that is white."
"Because he came home for lunch."
