When Al Smith was first elected governor of New York City, he went to a prison to inspect.
The warden asked him to say a few words to the prisoners. He didn't know where to start, but at last he said, "My citizens!"
Suddenly he thought that when a person is in the state prison, he is no longer a citizen, so he quickly changed his mind and said, "My prisoners!"
He didn't think that was appropriate either, so he quickly changed his mind and said, "Well, anyway, I'm glad to see so many of you here."
