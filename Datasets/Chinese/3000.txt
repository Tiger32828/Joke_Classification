A congressman speaks to voters in his district for re-election.
He said, "I have to work hard for the happy life of the American people. You know, it's really hard to be a congressman today if it's not better than before..."
One voter chimed in: "Yes, Your Excellency, it's not easy to be a Member of Parliament these days, but who doesn't want to be a Member of Parliament?"
