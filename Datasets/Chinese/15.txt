Pigs ask God to be reincarnated as human beings.
God asked, "Cultivation?"
Pig replied: "It's too bitter!"
God said, "Work?"
Pig replied: "Too tired!"
God said, "Be a monkey?"
Pig replied: "It's too difficult!"
God asked, "Why?"
The pig replied: "You can eat, play, and prostitute."
God was startled and said, "Damn it! Be a civil servant!"
