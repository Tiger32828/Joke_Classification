A man angrily said to the owner of the pet store, "You sold the dog to me as a gatekeeper, but last night a thief entered my house and stole 300 yuan from me. It didn't even bark."
The boss immediately replied: "The previous owner of this dog was a multi-millionaire, so 300 yuan is not considered at all."
