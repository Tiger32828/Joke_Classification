One day, Aaron of the freight company was using a computer to make a report.
The boss, who is not very good at using a computer, walked up to him and shook his head as soon as he saw the computer screen and said, "Aaron, I didn't mean to tell you, although I approved the purchase of the computer for you, you can't either. Take it for yourself!"
So, at the request of the boss, Aaron was very helpless, so he had to change the icon of "My Computer" on the "desktop" of the computer to "Company's computer"!
