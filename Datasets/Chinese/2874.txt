Someone came to a wine shop and asked a wine seller for a bottle of red wine,
After looking at it, he returned it to the wine seller and said to change a bottle of white wine. After getting the liquor, he left without paying.
The wine seller grabbed him and said, "Why did you take my wine without paying?"
The man said, "How come this bottle of white wine is yours? I got it for a bottle of red wine."
The wine seller said, "You didn't pay for the red wine either!"
The man said, "I don't have your wine, why do you want me to pay for it?"
