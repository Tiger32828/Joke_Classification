Bella, a famous French playwright, once went to a first-class restaurant for dinner. After the waiter brought soup, Bella said, "Waiter, I can't drink this kind of soup."
This restaurant is famous for its politeness. The waiter came over and apologized and took the soup away and brought the menu. Bella asked for another soup. When the soup came, Bella said, "Waiter, I No soup!"
This time, the waiter panicked and hurried to tell the manager. The manager came to Bella and said, "Sir, do you have any comments on the soup you just ordered? Many customers complimented the two soups!"
Bella: "I also think these two soups are very tasty, but I can't drink them!"
Manager: "What's the reason for that?"
Bella: "Because there is no spoon."
