A statistician met a mathematician, and the statistician teased the mathematician and said, "Didn't you say that if X=Y and Y=Z, then X=Z! Then presumably if you like a girl, then that girl Do you like the guy you like, too?"

The mathematician thought for a while and asked, "Then you put your left hand in a pot of boiling water of 100 degrees, and your right hand in a pot of ice water at zero degrees. It's okay to think about it, right? Because they are only fifty degrees on average!"
