Xiao Ming was brought to court for fraud.


As soon as he went to court, Xiao Ming saw the judge on the stage and thought that he would be saved this time.
Xiao Ming: "Judge, do you still remember me?"
Judge: "Aren't you the defendant in this fraud case?"
Xiao Ming: "You forgot, I introduced your wife to you 20 years ago, think about it."
Judge: "By the way, it's you. You lied to me 20 years ago. You are a repeat offender. The sentence is aggravated and you are sentenced to 20 years."
