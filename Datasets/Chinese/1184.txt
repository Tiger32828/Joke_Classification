The thing is, go to Bafangyunji to buy potstickers at night.
Since I didn't know what to eat, I decided to watch what other customers ordered at the door.

"10 spicy pot stickers" is what a little boy ordered.
I thought to myself, "Well, it's really a child."

Then a 35-year-old man said, "I want 7 spicy."
The girl who was standing on the frying platform lowered her head shyly and snickered to herself.
At this point, I thought to myself, "It turns out that if you eat pot stickers, you can also pick up girls by the way!"

So I stepped forward and shouted loudly, "Miss, I want 6 chives"
