Three men talk in a bar about who has the dumbest wife.
Man A said, "My wife is probably the dumbest woman in the world. Last week, the pork was on sale at the supermarket.
She thought it was cheap and bought pork for 3,000 yuan. The problem is that we don't have a refrigerator. "
Man B said, "What is this. My wife went out shopping last week,
She even bought a car worth 800,000 yuan for it on the spot. The problem is that she can't drive at all. "
Man C said, "So you think your wife is stupid, so what should I do? I came home last week,
My wife was going out with her luggage and said she was on a 15-day tour to Australia and New Zealand.
I checked her suitcase and found she had ten dozen condoms ready.
I didn't accompany her to play, why did she prepare condoms by herself? How stupid! "
