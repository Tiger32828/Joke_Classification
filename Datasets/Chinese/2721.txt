TV actor Harvey East, remembers when he was in the military, he was used by Ans to work with another soldier in the same battalion, Joe Louis, the US boxing champion.
One day they were driving a car and they were lightly hit by a van and the driver jumped out and put his face in Joe's face, obviously he didn't recognize the boxing champion, so he scolded and waited for him to swagger away Later, Harvey asked Joe why he was just there smiling and not knocking the truck driver down.
"Harvey" Joe said slowly, "When someone insults Caruso, will he sing a song for him?"
