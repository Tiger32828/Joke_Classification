Three men are in a bar discussing the gifts they bought for their wives.
The first man said: "I bought something that can go from 0 to 100 in six seconds"
The other two men didn't know what he was referring to, so he revealed the answer: "I bought my wife a pretty good Porsche"
The second man also said, "I bought something that can go from 0 to 100 in four seconds."
"That must be a Ferrari, right?"
"That's right! I bought my wife a really good red Ferrari"
A third man said, "I bought my wife something that goes from 0-100 in two seconds."
"Impossible! Ferrari is the fastest car in the world!"
"Well...that's not a car...that's a weight machine"
