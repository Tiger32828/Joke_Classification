I received a call from an unknown person yesterday.
Unlike the native accent, just call me by my first name!
"President Wang!"
"who are you?"
"Your old friend"
"Who is it?"
"Old friend from Taitung, you can't even hear my voice?"
"You are?"
"Oops, Mr. Wang, how forgetful you are."
I was really stopped by the question, and I couldn't remember the voice, so I exchanged greetings for a long time,
The other party just didn't say his name, and finally I got impatient.
"If you don't tell me," I hung up the phone. Then I thought something was wrong.
Possibly a liar, if I take the other person's voice as some old friend,
The other party will find a way to tell stories and cheat money.
I dialed the phone number back to the number just shown.
I said, "You are Zhang XX from Taitung, right?"
"Yes, yes, yes, look, I said that your nobleman has forgotten so much that you can't even hear my voice."
"I'm sorry, XX, I thought someone was joking with me."
"Mr. Wang, I'm going to Taipei for a business trip. I'll treat you to dinner by the way..."
I asked, "XX, how is your mother's cancer?"
The other party stayed for a while: "Oh... it's still the same"
"Well, there's nothing you can do with this disease. Is your father's car accident case closed?"
"Oh... it's almost there"
"Okay, everyone is gone, don't worry too much about whether you pay or not~"
"Okâ€¦"
I asked again, "Have you caught the hooligan who raped your wife?"
"Caught, caught"
I asked again, "Has your son's asshole surgery been done yet?"

The other party was silent for 10 seconds, did not speak, and hung up the phone...
