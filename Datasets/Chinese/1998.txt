There is an old lady who always hangs her clothes without getting caught in the rain. I heard that she has the ability to predict the direction of the rain.
When the rain comes from the east, she will pre-dry the west, and conversely, if the rain comes from the west, she will pre-dry the east,
One day, someone finally asked her, "Why don't you get caught in the rain when you hang your clothes?"
She said, "Tell you! That's where the rain comes from when I wake up in the morning to look at my husband!"
The man asked again, "Huh!? What if it's a crooked middle?"
The old lady said, "Alas~ back then, where would people still be in the mood to hang clothes~"
