One of the students had to go to tutoring after school. He was very tired. As soon as he got on the bus and sat in the front row, he started to sleep. It was raining that day, so the umbrella was placed next to the seat.
When he woke up suddenly and found that he had arrived at the station, he hurriedly grabbed the umbrella at hand and rushed out of the car.
Unexpectedly, after he got out of the car, the bus did not drive away. The driver jumped out of the car, chased after him and shouted, "Hey! Don't run, give me back my broom!"
