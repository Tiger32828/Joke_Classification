When a hunter went hunting and saw an orangutan, he picked up his bow and arrow to shoot the orangutan.
So the first arrow was shot out with a bang, but it was caught by the orangutan with a wave of his right hand.
So the hunter shot the second arrow with a bang, but it was caught by the orangutan with a wave of his left hand, but in the end the orangutan died just like that.
Because the orangutan was so happy, he used his habitual movements to beat his chest with both hands, but he didn't expect an arrow to be attached to his hand, so he was stabbed to death by the arrow...
