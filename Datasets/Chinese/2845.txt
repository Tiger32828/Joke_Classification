I remember when I was in elementary school, I once represented the school in an off-campus competition to play shuttlecock. It was a duo that time.
The opponent in front of him looked a little daunting. The floor was slippery that day, and I wasn't wearing sneakers.
During the competition, there was a sudden "whoosh" sound, and I actually fell to the ground!
At that time, I only felt that everyone in the audience was watching me, but I had to pretend that I was fine and continue to compete.
Unexpectedly, not long after, I heard a "Wow" again, and the player on the opposite side actually slipped! I feel really dark in my heart! (You fell instead
Oh! )
In the end, our group even won the second place in the entire Tainan County and Country Group! In fact, it's all relying on the classmates next to me to hold up the scene, I'm really sorry.......
