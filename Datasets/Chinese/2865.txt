When Emperor Jianwen of the Eastern Jin Dynasty was dealing with all kinds of problems, he liked to doodle elegantly. After writing, he asked his courtier Wang Xizhi: "Aiqing thinks, how do I write my words?"
The great calligrapher Wang Xizhi said: "The emperor's words are naturally good."
"How is it good? How does it compare to Qing?" Emperor Jian Wen asked.
"The word of the emperor is good among the emperor, and the word of the minister is good among the servants."
