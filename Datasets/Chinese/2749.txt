A young man reported to the airport, about to make his first skydive, and the pilot noticed that the young man was a little scared.
"Don't worry!" the pilot said, "when I slow down the plane, you just jump off. Then count five, pull the rope of the parachute, and the parachute will open over you and slowly float to the ground. Get up, there's a truck waiting to pick you up. If the parachute doesn't open, you reach for the spare paracord. Remember, there's a truck on the ground to pick you up!"

At three thousand feet, the novice jumped out of the cabin.
He counted to five and waited for the umbrella to open overhead, but nothing opened.
He pulled another rope, still nothing.
"My God!" he yelled. "I'm so lucky, I'm sure that truck wasn't there to pick me up either!"
