One day, a man and a woman were chatting.
Male: "If you let me catch up to female A, and let me live ten years less, I would also like to!"
Female: "What do you think about female B?"
Male: "If I can catch up, even if my life is only half left, I will be satisfied, what more can I ask for!"
Female: "What if it's female C?"
Male: "If I can catch up with her...even if there are only ten days left in my life, I have no complaints:..."
Female: "(very touched) So... what about me?"
Man: "(pondered for a while)...let me die right away!"
Female: "SHIT! #$%@#@:........."
