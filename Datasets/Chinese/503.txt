In the clinic waiting room, there was a grandma and aunt chatting.
Grandma said, "My grandson worked very hard when he was studying in Taiwan, but he became very lazy after studying in the United States."
Auntie: "How come?"
The grandmother replied, "Several times when I woke up from a nap and called the United States to find him, he said he was still sleeping."
