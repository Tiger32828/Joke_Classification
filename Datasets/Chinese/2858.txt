One day, after shopping alone, I was in a hurry to go home and watch TV, so I quickly rode my car and went home.
But halfway through the ride, I suddenly realized that the seat cushion has become higher and the handlebars have become crooked...
Look down - oh my God! This...isn't my car at all!
I had to ride desperately back to the store, back to the scene, looking left, right, front, back, no one was there,
Fortunately, my car was still there, so I quickly walked over, put someone else's car away, and rode my car away from the scene without looking back!
When I got home, the TV had already finished airing, so I could only blame myself for not having enough "gold"!
