Someone went to the hotel to open a room, and the waiter said that the room was full!
He didn't want to find another hotel. He ran to the upstairs corridor and shouted, "Open the door, the police will round the room!"
Then go downstairs and wait. After a while, several couples of men and women hurried downstairs to check out!
He walked to the main station: "Get me a room."
