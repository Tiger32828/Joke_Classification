The mother put her hands on her hips and said, "I was left behind by the teacher....I failed the exam again, didn't I!"
Child: "This time the question is more difficult. Everyone did not do well in the test. Only one person got full marks! I got 50 points, which is not bad."
Mother: "The good is better than the bad, why don't you look at how people get 100 points in the test!"

Another day the mother took the child through McDonald's.

Child: "Mom, I want to go in for a hamburger and fries."
Mother: "What do you eat? Don't you know how many children in Africa don't even have to eat?"
Child: "Good is better than bad..."
