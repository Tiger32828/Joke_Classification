A man was dying of starvation in the desert when he found a magic lamp.
Magic Lamp: "I can only fulfill your one wish, hurry up, I'm in a hurry."
Person: "I want a wife..."
The magic lamp immediately turned into a beautiful woman, and then said disdainfully, "I'm dying of starvation and still covet beauty! It's pathetic!" and then disappeared.
Person: "...Bread."
