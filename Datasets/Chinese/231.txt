The weather was hot and the hospital was noisy. The nurse raised her voice to roll the name, hoping to reduce the waiting time for the doctor's consultation.
"Close the wrong bird! Shut the wrong bird!" the nurse screamed twice, but there was no response except for a surprised snicker.
"Kuan the wrong bird, Miss Guan, is there Miss Guan at the scene? You are next!" the nurse shouted to the crowd waiting outside the clinic.
An Obasan slowly got up, swayed his big butt, and moved towards the nurse while carrying his body.
"Miss nurse, my surname is Guan, did you call me?"
Hurry up, come here and wait, the next one is you, the nurse gave her a light hand.
"Ah, but I'm not called Guan Wrong Bird?" Obasan underestimated the nurse who was looking down at a stack of horizontal medical records.
The nurse raised her head and said to her, the medical record says "Close the wrong bird"!
Obasan was stunned for a moment, then changed his position to look next to the nurse.
This time, it was replaced by Obasanla in a loud voice: "Teacher! The grandmother is called Guan Jinque, you call me Guan wrong bird!"
