A couple went to the wishing well to make a wish
The husband tossed in a gold coin and began to make a wish.
The wife wanted to make a wish when she saw it, and she also threw a gold coin down, accidentally! The whole person fell into the well.
The husband was stunned for a moment, then said to himself with a smirk, "It's really spiritual to make a wish!"
