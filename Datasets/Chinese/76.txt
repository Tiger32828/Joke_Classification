A gangster brother went to the dental office to have his teeth pulled,
After pulling out, take the medicine list and go to the pharmacy to get the medicine...
After returning home, I forgot the way of taking the medicine that the pharmacist explained...
In a hurry, call back to the dental clinic to ask
Brother: "There are so many pills, how do you take them?"
Nurse: "Eat if you are swollen, don't eat if you are not swollen."

As a result, the brother took all the medicine...
