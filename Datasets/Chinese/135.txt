A woman was helping her four-year-old son find clothes and found a piece of clothing in the closet that was two years old and had been forgotten.
She said to her son: "It's too bad, this dress has been around for two years and it's gotten so small that you can't wear it anymore."
Soon, a friend gave her son a new dress, but unfortunately it was too big. The son said to her, "Mom, I have a solution. Put it in the closet and make it smaller, so I can wear it!"
