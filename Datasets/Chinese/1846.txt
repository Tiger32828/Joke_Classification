One day, the Department of Zoology of X University held a biology quiz.
The teacher came in with a bird cage, covered with a piece of cloth and asked the students to guess the name of the bird by looking at the bird's feet.
Soon one of the classmates finished the answer, handed in the test paper and put it on the desk, and left in a hurry...
When the teacher looked at the exam paper, he was surprised that the name of the class number was not written, and hurriedly stopped the students.
Suddenly, the student pulled up his trousers and said, "You can't tell just by looking at your feet?"
