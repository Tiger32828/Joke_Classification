When the cold snap hit, Xiaojuan heard a roasted sweet potato hawker at the intersection one night, picked up her wallet and put on her coat and went out to buy. The temperature outside was quite low at night, and the vendors of roasting sweet potatoes wore thick coats and spit out white smoke from time to time.
Xiaojuan chose three sweet potatoes, and the hawker weighed them and then quoted: "Total 64 yuan, 60 yuan for you."
Xiaojuan said, "It's so cold that I came out to sell roasted sweet potatoes. I insist on paying you the full amount." After paying, she picked up the sweet potatoes and prepared to go home.
The hawker quickly stopped Xiaojuan and said embarrassedly, "Thank you, Miss, but you only have to give me four yuan!"
Xiaojuan: "..."
