There is an Abo... who admits to being a "living dragon" at the age of 60, and often shows off to others!
One day, in the public toilet, I saw a young man next to him, his hands below him, shhhhhh...
Thinking that the opportunity is not to be missed, let's have a good time: "Young man, it's so useless? Seven teenagers and eight teenagers... You still need to hold your hands with both hands when you pee?"
The young man turned his head in disdain and said coldly, "Abo! I'm holding it down!"
