The stewardess will take the oral exam after training.
The examiner asked, "What should I do if an engine fails during flight?"
She replied, "Keep flying."
The examiner asked again, "What if the two engines fail?"
"Still continue to fly, but keep in constant contact with the airport," she said.
The examiner asked again, "What if all three engines fail?"
"Still moving forward, but in close contact with the control tower," she said.
The examiner finally asked, "What if all four engines fail?"
She sighed and said, "That's just contact with the ground right away!"
