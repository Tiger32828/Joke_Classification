The wife tried her best to scold her husband for never buying back what she needed.
From the evening until going to bed, the wife has been nagging non-stop, which greatly annoyed the man.
One day, the husband finally brought a treasure home and said to his wife, "My dear, this is what you need most, otherwise, it is what I need."
The wife happily opened it and saw that it was a bottle of "sleeping pills".
