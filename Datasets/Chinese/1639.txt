A girl meets a gangster at night. The gangster asked fiercely, "Stop! Why are you going?"
The girl didn't want to be robbed, so she said pitifully, "Go and borrow money."
The gangster still asked fiercely, "Why are you borrowing money?"
The girl was also afraid of being robbed, so she said, "There is no money for a venereal disease."
The gangster roared: "Go away!"
