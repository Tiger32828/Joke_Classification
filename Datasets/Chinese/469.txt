Four surgeons chat about which patients are the easiest to operate on.
"I think it's an accountant," said the first doctor. "After you cut open his body, you'll see that all the internal organs are numbered, and there will be no confusion."
"The librarian is also good," said the second doctor. "The internal organs are sorted by category."
The third doctor said, "I like to operate on professors. They will understand why when we operate on patients, we just pretend to cut and sew the patient's body and do nothing."
The last doctor has the most seniority,
“My favorite is to operate on high-ranking government officials,” he said. “They have no heart, no waist, no guts, and their heads and butts are interchangeable.”
