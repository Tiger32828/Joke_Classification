Xiao Ming asked Xiao Qiang and Xiao Li, "How do I make the cat bite the pepper?"
Xiaoqiang: "Catch the cat, pry open his mouth, and stuff the peppers in."
Xiao Ming: "No, that's forcing. The cat has to voluntarily bite the pepper."
Xiao Li: "Hide the peppers in the belly of the fish, and the cat will eat it."
Xiao Ming: "No, that's cheating. Cats need to know that they are biting peppers."
Xiao Ming: "It's actually very simple~ Put the peppers in the cat's butt, and it will be very happy to bite the peppers!"
