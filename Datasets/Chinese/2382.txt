Xiaobai went to change his driver's license today and passed an intersection.

I saw a mother carrying a child on her back and an older child in front of her was stopped by the police...

The policeman said, "Ma'am, it's okay if your child doesn't wear a helmet.

Why don't you wear it yourself? That can't be said. "

Mom: "You can't buy a child so small."

Note: "But you should wear it yourself!"

Mom: "Why am I wearing it? If something happens to my child, I don't want to live anymore!"

police:"……@_@……"

Mother! so amazing.....
