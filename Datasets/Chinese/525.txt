A cigarette dealer was talking about the benefits of smoking at a promotion.
Suddenly, an old man stepped onto the podium and said loudly, "You know what? There are three other benefits of smoking!
First, dogs are afraid of people who smoke.
Second, thieves dare not steal smoking from others.
Third, smokers are always young. "

For a time, the audience in the audience was excited, and the cigarette dealer was even more overjoyed.

The old man waved his hand again and said, "Why?
First, people who smoke are more hunched, and the dog sees it and thinks it is about to pick up stones and hit it.
Second, the smoker coughs at night, and the thief thinks he has not slept, so he dare not steal!
Third, smokers are short-lived, so they are forever young. "
