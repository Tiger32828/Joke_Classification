On a whim, a wife wanted to surprise her husband, so she put on a wig and changed into a new set of clothes.
And put on a different makeup than usual, and then went to the husband's office and said coquettishly: "Hush! Handsome man, do you want to be with me..."
His husband glanced at her and immediately interrupted her by saying, "No! I don't think about anything. As soon as I see you, I think of my wife."
