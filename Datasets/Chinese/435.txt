Today at KFC while eating and watching the stock, a beggar came in and stretched out his hand to beg,
I continued to look at the stock after I gave him a spicy wing.
The beggar gnawed on the spicy wings and didn't leave. Instead, he whispered beside me: "The long-term moving average crosses, the bottom of the KDJ value is repeatedly passivated, the MACD deviates from the low level, and the energy tide opens up. This stock is about to rise."
I was surprised and asked, "You know this too?!"
The beggar said, "It is because I understand this that I am like this today..."
