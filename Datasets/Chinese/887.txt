Lao Wang runs a large farm, which raises all kinds of cattle, one of which is a breeding cattle, which is specially used for mating. After a few years, the bred cattle are also brought to Lao Wang. A lot of wealth has come. As time goes by, the physical condition of this bull is not as good as before, and because he is old, he is more and more unable to do what he wants. Watching Lao Wang is shaking his head frequently, thinking hard every day.

Finally, once the old cow fainted in the cow stall due to lack of energy, Lao Wang was alerted to the seriousness of the situation, and immediately went to the town to buy a young and strong cow to replace the work of the old cow. That night, Lao Wang kept the new cattle and the old cattle together temporarily, and then let the new cattle have their own houses after the old cattle died.

In the middle of the night, the whole bullpen was crying constantly, and Lao Wang couldn't sleep well, so he got up and went to the bullpen to see what was going on. By the way, he also comforted the old bull. As soon as Lao Wang entered the bullpen, he saw the old bull lying on the ground. The ground was crying miserably, so he went up to stroke its head and said, "O Niu! O Niu! I know that I have wronged you when I bought a new cow, but you have helped me for so many years. Don't worry, I won't kill you, so don't be sad anymore."


The old cow looked at Lao Wang with a pair of sad eyes, "Did you tell the new guy that I'm male?"
