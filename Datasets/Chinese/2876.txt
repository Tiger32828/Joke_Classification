The teacher asked, "What about painting?"
The student replied, "Here." He pointed to the blank paper and said.
Teacher: "What are you drawing?"
Student: "The cow eats grass."
Teacher: "Where's the grass?"
Student: "The cows are all eaten."
Teacher: "Where's the cow?"
Student: "The grass is gone, what are the cows doing standing there?"
