There was a man who was very afraid of his wife, because he ate a box of rice cakes because he was greedy at night, he was punished by his wife to kneel until midnight before going to bed.
The more he thought about it, the more unwilling he became. He wanted to calculate whether his life was good or not.
As soon as the fortune teller saw him, he asked, "How much is 'Gui Geng'?"
He quickly said, "I didn't 'kneel' for long, I only knelt until the third watch."
The fortune-teller said, "I'm not referring to this, I'm asking you how tall you are?"
He said repeatedly, "How many boxes of 'rice cake' do you dare to eat? Of course, I only ate one box."
