The teacher said that he went to a girls' school to give a speech about astrology and astrology~
A lovely girl raised her hand and said to the teacher, "Teacher, I don't believe in any constellation, astrology, fortune-telling, etc."
After hearing this, the teacher was very happy and wanted to say, "There are actually girls who advocate science rather than being obsessed with constellations!"
So I asked the lovely female classmate, "Classmate, why can you tell the teacher why?"
The lovely female classmate replied seriously: "Teacher, because I am a Gemini, Gemini people will not be superstitious!"
