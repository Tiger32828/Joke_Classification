Lao Wang stipulated that his son should keep a diary every day, and he also worked hard to check his son's diary every night.
One day, after reading his diary, he was furious with his son's mother.
Lao Wang's wife was inexplicable, and Lao Wang angrily said, "I have evidence!"
He opened his son's diary, spread it out on the table, and wrote crookedly: "Today, Uncle Li came to my house to play. After I finished my homework, my uncle praised me for doing well. Uncle kissed my mother and kissed me. "
After reading it, the wife became even more angry and scolded her son. The son cried: "I got the punctuation wrong, it should be: 'Uncle kissed me, mother kissed me'!"
