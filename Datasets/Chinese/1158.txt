The millionaire stopped the car when he saw two beggars pulling grass and eating by the side of the road while driving a luxurious stretch "Lincoln" sedan through a village.
"Why do you eat grass?"
"We really have no money..." a beggar replied.
"Really, get in the car and go to my house."
"I have a wife and two children at home..." a beggar muttered.
"Call them!"
The rich man pointed to another beggar. "And you, call your family too."
"My family has a large population. In addition to my wife, I have five children," said another beggar.
"It doesn't matter, call them all, go!"
In this way, the two beggars and their families got into the car, but fortunately it was an extended car.
During the exercise, a beggar's wife said gratefully: "Boss, you are so kind, you can even invite poor people like us home.

The millionaire replied: "It's nothing, I just came back from abroad, and my house has been unattended. The lawn in the yard may be over a meter high, you can eat enough!"
