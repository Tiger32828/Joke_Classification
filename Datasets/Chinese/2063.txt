There is a pharmacy that advertises its medicine as an elixir, which is invalid and free.
One day, a man had a bad cough and came to buy cough medicine.
After rummaging through the pharmacy, the man found that the cough medicine had been sold out, but because the boss asked that the customer must not return empty-handed, and the medicine must be cured.
The guy took a bottle of medicine and sold it to this man and said, "Take it right away, it's guaranteed to be effective."
After the customer finished eating, they just walked to the door and immediately squatted down. The boss was startled and rushed out: "What's wrong with him?"
Buddy: "He coughs."
Boss: "What medicine do you sell him?"
Buddy: "Laxatives."
Boss: "He coughs, why did you ask him to take laxatives?"
Buddy: "The company's highest guiding principle - until the medicine is cured, you can see if he still dares to cough."
