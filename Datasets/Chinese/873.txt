In a bank robbery case in the United States, the robber was arrested by the sheriff just after hiding the money.
Since the robbers were Indians and could not speak English, the sheriff had to ask an interpreter to help translate.
After a tiring and bombarded interrogation, the robbers insisted that they would not reveal where the money was hidden.
There was no way, the sheriff had no choice but to put on a black face and roared to the interpreter: "Tell the robber, don't tell, and kill him!"
The translator faithfully conveyed the meaning of the sheriff, probably translated too well,
The robber was incoherent: "The money is in the well in the middle of the town, please ask him to spare my life."
The interpreter told the sheriff with a solemn expression: "This kid has a kind of kind, and he would rather die than move. He tells you to kill him."
