This is a real anecdote that happened on a flight in North America.

Before the plane takes off,
The flight attendant broadcast: "Everyone, the flight will be delayed due to xxxx. If you think about it, you can take a walk in the terminal..."
A well-known black singer who was blind in the United States was also on the flight.
The captain came over and said to the black singer, "Do you need to get up and take a walk?"
The black singer said, "Thank you, no. But can you take my guide dog for a walk?"
The captain was happy to help him.
Later, I heard that because the passengers saw the captain walking by with dark sunglasses and a guide dog, no one dared to board the plane when it was boarding time. It took the ground crew three hours in total to persuade the passengers to re-board.
