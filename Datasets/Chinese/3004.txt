The farmer and the scholar were in the same boat. They were bored and decided to play a guessing game.
The two decided that if the scholar lost, they would pay ten yuan to the farmer, and five yuan otherwise.
The farmer said, "What weighs five hundred pounds in the river and only ten pounds on the bank?"
The scholar thought hard and did not know, so he paid the farmer ten yuan.
Asking the farmer for the answer, the farmer said, "I don't know either."
He returned the scholar five yuan, leaving the scholar stunned.
