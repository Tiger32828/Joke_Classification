A little girl has been learning the piano for several years
(You must be forced to learn the piano after an hour, and if you make mistakes, you will be punished or replayed....)
Finally it was her turn to give the concert
Always nervous the first time
However, it does not live up to the expectations of teachers and parents
Played perfectly
The audience under the stage applauded one by one
shouting "encore"
This little girl doesn't know what "encore" is
The teacher said they want you to play it again
The little sister wanted to cry
"I didn't play it wrong again, why should I play it again"
woohoo~~~
