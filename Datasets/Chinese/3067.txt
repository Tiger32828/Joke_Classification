The doctor said to an alcoholic, "Drinking too much alcohol damages the liver, why don't you restrain yourself?"
The drunkard asked, "What kind of restraint method?" The doctor suggested: "For example, draw a line on the wine bottle, and don't drink it every time."
The drunkard said helplessly: "I tried this method, but every time I didn't drink that line, I fell unconscious."
