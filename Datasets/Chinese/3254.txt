On the night of Black Friday, Yalin was a little dizzy. He was driving a taxi and wanted to finish work early.
Suddenly, a girl with flowing hair and a bloodless face stopped the car. Yalin thought it might not be those dirty things.
So she was nervous and let her get in the car. After the girl got in the car, she actually said she was going to the Hong Kong funeral home.
After arriving at the destination, the girl disappeared after getting out of the car. Yalin was so frightened that she wanted to step on the accelerator and leave immediately.
Suddenly a hand came in through the window, and a faint voice said to Yalin:
"Driver, please don't park by the ditch next time you park, okay?"
