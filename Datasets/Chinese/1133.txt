The forgetful old professor was traveling by train. When the conductor came to check the ticket, he could not find the ticket. The old professor was sweating profusely.
The conductor said: "If you can't find it, it's fine, just make up another ticket!"
Old professor: How is this possible? If I can't find the ticket, I don't know where I'm going!
