After many choices in life, Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism, finally had an epiphany under the Bodhi tree and reached the superego state. Like his hardships, his preaching was far from plain sailing.
Once, a man interrupted his sermon by insulting Shakyamuni with dirty words.
Shakyamuni waited for him to finish cursing and asked him, "If one person gives a gift to another, and the gift-giver refuses to accept the gift, then who should the gift belong to?"
"Of course it should belong to the person who gave the gift." The man, the monk Zhang Er, replied in confusion.
"Okay," Shakyamuni said, "I refuse to accept your filthy words, and return it to you now."
