I remember when I went to the driving class seven years ago, the coach really didn't fucking know that he was in the third child.

Coach: Driving so fast, are you rushing to eat shit?
Me: I'm sorry coach
Coach: Drive so slow, you can't keep up with the heat if you eat shit
I:..............

Coach: Did you see that person in front of you?
Me: yes I have seen
Coach: Hit him to death
Me: Coach is this bad?
Coach: Then you don't fucking hit the brakes?

Coach: Did you see that female classmate driving?
The windshield was clean and it wasn't raining, but she had the wipers on,
You have to pay attention, because she is about to turn! ! !
Me: Um...thanks coach....

Over the years, I have been thankful for the coach's reminders and teachings to live until now! !
