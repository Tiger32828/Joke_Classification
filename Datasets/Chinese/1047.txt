That night, the sports station on TV was broadcasting the weightlifting championship. Ade sat in front of the TV and watched intently. Whenever a competitor lifted the dumbbell, Ade would shout, "Okay!"
Then, the wife Meihui next to her also shouted, "Okay!"
When Ader's most admired weightlifter came on stage, unfortunately, his performance was abnormal, Ader could only sigh, but Meihui still shouted: "Okay!"
Ade looked at Meihui and asked her with a puzzled face: "Dear, I really watched the weightlifting competition for a long time, did you understand?"
Meihui: "Of course there is! Look at the floor that was smashed by such a heavy dumbbell, and it's still in good condition. That floor is really good!"
