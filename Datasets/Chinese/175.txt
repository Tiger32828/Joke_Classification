One day, when my elder sister brought her younger sister home, there was a dog mating by the roadside.
My sister said, "Are those two dogs doing hemp?"
The older sister blushed and said, "They are fighting~~"
A boy behind him burst out laughing.
The elder sister said angrily, "You want to be numb!"
The boy smiled and said, "You want to fight!"
