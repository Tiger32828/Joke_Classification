Jiachuan and Feijie went into the mountains to hunt together. After they camped together one night, Feijie took a gun and said he was going out to cheetah.
"Don't go!" Carrie warned him. "Cheetahs are very dangerous at night!"
"Joke," Feige said, "if I bring a leopard back, will you skin it for me?"
"I will," Carrie said, "but I advise you not to go!"
Feige left him alone and went out on his own, and within thirty yards he saw a mountain leopard approaching in the moonlight.
He fired, and the leopard was slightly wounded on its left foot. It rushed towards Fijé angrily, and Fijé dropped the gun and ran away.
When Feige returned to the backstage, the leopard was still reluctant to come. He had no choice but to enter through the front door of the tent and escape straight to the back door.
In this way, Carrie was awakened by him.
When Feijie went out through the back door and the mountain leopard entered the tent through the front door, Feijie turned back and shouted to Carrie, "Carrie, this is the first one. Just skin it. I'll go out and find the second one. go!"
