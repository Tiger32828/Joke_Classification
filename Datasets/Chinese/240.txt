One day, when I had nothing to do, all parts of the computer complained and told my heartache, blood and tears:
The screen said, "It's a shame I have to be seen every day!"
Not to be outdone, the keyboard continued, "I am miserable! People touch it every day."
After hearing this, the mouse also complained: "So, wouldn't I be even worse? I have to be beaten every day."
The host said, "What's that, I have to press the belly button every day."
The motherboard couldn't help but vomit bitterly: "Everything you said is good, it's not like me, I have to be plugged in every day."
The floppy disk drive interjected and said, "It's okay if someone plugs it in, like me, I want someone to plug it in, but no one wants to plug it in!"
The motherboard retorted: "Don't think that I will be very comfortable with a lot of things plugged in. In fact, I am the hardest. When those things are inserted, they will not move. Do you know how uncomfortable it is?"
The sound card finally couldn't hold back his breath: "What else! It was you who was plugged in, why am I in charge of calling?"
