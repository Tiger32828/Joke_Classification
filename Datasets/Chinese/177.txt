The company stipulates the new leave request standard. In view of the excessive absence of colleagues in the company, the following regulations will take effect immediately!
△Sick leave:
No! We believe that since you have the strength to go to the doctor, you can afford to come to work.
△Bereavement leave:
No reason! Your presence does not benefit the deceased, much less bring him back to life.
△Long vacation (such as surgery and other personal leave):
We no longer approve this matter. Colleagues should put an end to the idea of ​​surgery. As long as you are a regular employee of the company, you should not remove any part of your body without permission. The company employs all of you. If you remove a part of you without permission, it will violate the relevant contract provisions that the company originally hired.
△Death:
This is the only valid reason, but you must notify the personnel department three weeks in advance, as it is one of your duties to hand over the replacement.
△Another: According to the report statistics, colleagues spend too much time in the bathroom! From today onwards, please take turns to enter and use according to the alphabetical order of their names. For example, names starting with an "A" may use the restroom from 8:00 to 8:15. If the letter of the name starts with "B", you can use the bathroom from 8:15 to 8:30. This is the order. Note: In case everyone misses their respective use time, you can only use the restroom. Until tomorrow, wait until it's your turn again to use the restroom.

Please abide by it and don't make a mistake! !
