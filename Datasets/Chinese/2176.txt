After the husband and wife quarreled, the husband was amusingly playing with the cat.
Seeing this, his wife scolded, "What are you doing with that pig?"
The husband was surprised and said, "This is a cat, not a pig!"
The wife immediately replied, "Why are you interrupting when I'm talking to the cat?"
