Recently, Aman's mother's two daughters have learned to swim the butterfly style.
On Sunday, Aman's mother took her baby daughter to swim in the heated swimming pool in Xiaojizi's community.
After watching the swimming skills of the two sisters, the little sister said with admiration and admiration, "Big sister, you swim so well! You are like a beautiful butterfly!"
The younger daughter asked curiously and expecting praise, "Brother, what about me?"
The younger son answered her very honestly: "It's like a 'stuffed butterfly'."
