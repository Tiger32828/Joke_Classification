One day two rich men were gossiping in a bar.
One of them said to the other, "Hey! I'm telling you my driver is really stupid, just look at it..."
He called his driver Jimmy over and said, "Here's 100 yuan, go to the car show area and buy me a Mercedes back."
Jimmy replied, "Yes, sir. I'll be right there."
I went to the car showroom. The rich man said to his friend, "Look, I told you he was stupid!"
And another rich man said, "That's nothing, you see a fool, I'll show you a fool."
Then he called his driver Billy over: "Billy, go home and see if I'm home."
And Billy replied, "Yes, sir, I'll be right there," and ran home.
"See? He doesn't even have a brain! Thinking how could I be at home if I'm here!"
Later, the two drivers met on the street.
Jimmy said to Billy, "Hey, you know what? My boss is really stupid. He actually gave me 100 yuan and told me to go to the car showroom and buy him a Mercedes... Doesn't he know it's Sunday? The car show area is not open at all!‚Äù
Billy replied, "My boss is much dumber than he is. He even told me to go home to see if he was there. He has a cell phone, doesn't he? Can't he call himself?"
