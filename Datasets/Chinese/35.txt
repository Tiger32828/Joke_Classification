One day a man brought a dog to the record company, he said he was the manager of the dog, and said he could sing and dance and so on,
The boss didn't believe it, so he asked the puppy to perform once. When the music starts, the dog sings and dances to the music,
The boss stared at the puppy in astonishment, thinking that he had found a cash cow this time, he quickly took out the contract and hoped to sign with the dog,
Unexpectedly, a big dog rushed in and took the puppy away.
The boss asked, "What's going on?"
The agent said helplessly: "Alas! That's his mother. His mother wants his son to become a doctor. The entertainment industry is too complicated!"
