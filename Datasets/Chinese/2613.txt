There was a nursing school intern working in the emergency room, which was tedious and stressful.
One day I was instructed to take care of an old lady, she kindly said in her tattered Taiwanese: "Grandma, I am a student of "You Die" (Nursing Department), and the doctor told me to take "Courage" (oxygen). How about you "die or die" (suck it)!"
The old lady's face changed greatly when she heard this, and she quickly refused: "Mai La! Mai La!" (Don't! Don't!)
The female student said: "How can you be Micah, hurry up! Clamp 'die' (suck)!"
