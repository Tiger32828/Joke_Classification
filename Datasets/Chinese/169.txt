Last night, when I took the last MRT back to Tamsui, two little devils stuck to a pillar by the door, kissing me.
"ã„Ÿ, do you love me?" the woman asked.
"Love, love, love that you got two sausages and two bottles of red wine." The man replied.
"Well what does that mean!"
"I love you for a long time (intestine wine and wine)."
"Then you don't love me?" This time it was the man's turn to ask.
"Of course. I love you so much..." The girl paused, "I love you to hang the alarm clock in the toilet."
"What?" the boy asked suspiciously.
"It is love that has a beginning and an end (there is shit and a bell)."
