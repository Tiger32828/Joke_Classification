One day, the county magistrate Luo, who was naturally squinting, dignifiedly interrogated three prisoners in court.
He patted the gavel and asked the first prisoner, "Why do you want to kill?"
The second prisoner replied in fear, "My lord, I didn't kill anyone."
The magistrate looked at him sideways and said, "Who told you to speak?"
The third prisoner said in fear, "Sir, the villain didn't speak!"
