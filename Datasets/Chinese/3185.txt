A doctor saw a young man at a banquet.
"I must thank you, doctor," said the young man. "I have benefited a lot from your medical skills."
The doctor stared at the young man in confusion: "But—you—" he said, "I don't think you were ever my patient."
"Of course I'm not your patient, but my uncle is your patient, and I'm his heir."
