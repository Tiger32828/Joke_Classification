Recently, the international situation is tense, and the Ministry of National Defense has urgently recruited troops. A farmer in the countryside was also recruited. The military gave them three days of training.
On the first day, I taught the art of stabbing spears. When the stabbing spear was fired, it was finished before the farmer, and the squad leader gave him a stick. Tell him, "When the enemy comes with a bayonet and says, 'This is a lance, this is a lance, I stab.' The enemy will die."
The next day I taught rifles. When the rifle was issued, it was finished before the farmer. The squad leader gave him a broom and told him: "When the enemy came, he took the rifle and said: 'This is a rifle, This is a rifle, I am BONBONBON.” The enemy will die.”
Unexpectedly, the two sides fought on the third day, and the farmer had to reluctantly play. Suddenly, an enemy came in front. The farmer took out his stick and said, "This is a stab gun, this is a stab gun..." As you can imagine, the enemy is of course fine.
Then, the farmer immediately took out a broom and said, "This is a rifle, this is a rifle, I am BONBONBON..." The enemy was still fine and slowly approaching.
The farmer was very nervous, thinking that he might be killed in battle. I'm sorry for the old and young at home. When I was feeling hopeless....
The enemy was already in front of him, knocked him to the ground, and walked straight behind him, saying, "This is a tank, this is a tank..."
