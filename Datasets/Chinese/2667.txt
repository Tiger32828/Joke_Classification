A certain gentleman was speaking on the topic of prohibition on the stage, saying: "Everyone! Suppose there are two barrels, the right barrel holds water, the left barrel holds wine, and there is a horse, which barrel do you think it will drink?"
Suddenly a hotel apprentice replied, "Of course I'm going to drink water!"
A certain prince asked loudly, "Why does it love water?" The apprentice stood up and replied, "Because it has no knowledge."
