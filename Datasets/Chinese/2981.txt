There was a doctor who became a door-to-door son-in-law.
One day, the husband said to his son-in-law, "You have been studying for a long time, wait for me to test you."
He spat his saliva on the table, blew out the lamp, and asked, "What book is this?"
The son-in-law said, "This is "Dantai Deming". The husband was overjoyed.
The son-in-law said, "You have become a doctor for the first time, and I will test you too."
He also blew out the lights, pinched his husband's nose and twisted it around, asking, "What kind of medicine is this?"
The husband said, "I don't know this medicine."
The son-in-law said, "I don't know about black morning glory (Chinese herbal medicine)?"
