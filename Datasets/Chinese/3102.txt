The lighthouse keeper subscribes to a weekly newspaper.
Every time the postman delivered him a newspaper, he was not happy, because it was too troublesome to row the boat for an hour for this newspaper.
On this day, the postman delivered the newspaper to the lighthouse again with a face full of impatience.
The lighthouse keeper said calmly: "Next time, please smile, or I will revise a daily newspaper immediately!"
