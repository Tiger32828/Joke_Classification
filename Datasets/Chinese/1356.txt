In the company, only President Wang and Director Liu are married, and the two men often exchange their experiences after marriage together.
Mr. Wang said: My wife may be in menopause. She is very forgetful. She often carries a kitchen knife and searches for a kitchen knife. Sometimes I really can't stand her.
Director Liu: "Your situation is much better than mine. My wife often finds me all over the house with a kitchen knife."
