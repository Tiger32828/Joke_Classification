Of all the western industrial countries, France has probably the worst telephone system.
Half of the calls in Paris never get through the first time.
Can't hear what the other person said. It takes an average of eleven to seventeen months to install a new phone.
A Frenchman waited thirteen years.
The popular joke about telephones in Paris is that the French population can be divided into two categories:
One is waiting for the phone to be installed, and the other is waiting for a dial tone.
