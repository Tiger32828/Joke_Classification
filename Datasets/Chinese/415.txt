Monday, February 30 Sunny
It's not good that the sun didn't come out all day today. Dad bought two goldfish and kept one in the tank and drowned one. I'm very sad.

Teacher's comment: I am also very sad, I have lived so much, and I have never met a 30th in February! I have never seen a sunny day without the sun, let alone a goldfish that would drown.
