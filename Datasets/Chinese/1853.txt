A school strictly forbids cheating in exams, and the math professor asked everyone to sign a statement,
Indicates that he did not accept any assistance or assistance from anyone during the exam,
The exam papers are all done by myself.
Everyone has signed, but one classmate is still hesitant.
When the professor came to understand, he replied, "I once prayed and asked God for help, but I don't know if I should sign?"
After reading his exam paper carefully, the professor said in a determined tone, "Don't worry! God didn't help you."
