I believe everyone still remembers that when you asked for personal leave in elementary school, you must submit a leave slip to the teacher in advance.

My classmate teaches the third grade of elementary school,
One day one of her students had to go back to the south because of the death of her grandmother.
Therefore, on the "Reason" of the leave slip, it was written: "Funeral".

My classmate corrected him and said that the "reason" should be what the person who asked for leave was going to do.
As a result, the child nodded, took the seat back and changed it, and brought the changed personal leave list soon after.
I saw that the "reason" was changed from "funeral" to "accompanying funeral"!
