Miaoli held a bragging contest, the first one was a farmer and a foreigner! !
The farmer said, "I have 100 sports cars, 32,220,000 pings of houses, 5,000 computers, and a major shareholder in 900 companies!!"
The foreigner only said one sentence, and the judges decided that the foreigner was the champion.

He said, "I'm his boss!"
