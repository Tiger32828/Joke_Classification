There was a beggar in a certain street, begging from passers-by on the street every day.
One day there was an extra bowl next to the beggar, but no one was watching.
Xiao Ming was curious, so he stepped forward and asked the beggar, "Why did you put two bowls?"
The beggar smiled and said, "I don't know why, business has been very good recently, so I opened a branch."
