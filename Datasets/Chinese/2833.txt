A school held a competition of "10 people and 11 feet", and I was lucky enough to be selected.
During the practice, everyone confidently stepped on a steady pace and marched towards the finish line.
Just when everyone was in full tacit understanding, suddenly a white "thing" flew past everyone's eyes!
When everyone still didn't know what the blob was, I shouted, "Ah! My shoe fell off!"
Suddenly, everyone burst into laughter; and my face was already as red as an apple.
