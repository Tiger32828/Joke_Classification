A blonde, a brunette, and a redhead hang out together in an accident and go to heaven at the same time.

When they reached the gates of heaven, God appeared to them and told them that they needed to pass the laughter test.
They need to climb 100 flights of stairs, and every flight of stairs has a joke. But if they couldn't help laughing, they would be sent to hell.

The brown-haired beauty climbed first, laughing on the 46th flight of stairs.
The red-haired beauty set off second, laughing on the 77th flight of stairs.
The blonde beauty climbed to the 100th floor and suddenly burst into laughter.

God felt a pity and asked, "Why are you laughing? It's only one floor away."
The blonde replied, "Oh! I thought of the first joke. It was funny."
