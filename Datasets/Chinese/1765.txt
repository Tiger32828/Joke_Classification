There is a woman whose husband is a lawyer who specializes in divorce cases. She said, "Husband, don't file a divorce lawsuit in the future. It's a bit immoral to tear up people's families."
Her husband: "You can make money by splitting a pair and making two pairs, but what's wrong with accumulating virtue and doing good deeds."
