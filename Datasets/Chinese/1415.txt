Ami and Ahua are very good friends and often get together to chat
One day, Ami worriedly said to A Hua, "I have to be more careful recently!"
Ah Hua was very concerned and said why? Amei said, "I'm afraid what if I accidentally get pregnant!"
Ah Hua said, "It's strange that your husband didn't go for sterilization a few days ago. What are you afraid of?"
Amei said, "It's because she went to get a sterilization that I'm scared! I haven't even told you yet. How did you know that my husband went to get a sterilization?"
Ah Hua said, "Your husband told me! He said he had been sterilized, so I don't need to worry about it in the future!"
