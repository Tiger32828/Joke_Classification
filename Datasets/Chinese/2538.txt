Da Ding went to visit the new neighbor who moved in next door. The neighbor said, "Hello, my surname is Bai."
Da Dai asked, "Mr. Bai, where did you get a high school degree?"
Mr. Bai said, "I am a logician."

Dazed: "Yes, it's still a big wolf dog!"
Mr. Bai: "If you have a dog, then logically, you have a dog house!"
Dazed: "That's right!"
Mr. Bai: "Okay, if you have a dog and a dog house, then you have children?"
Dazed: "Not bad at all!"
Mr. Bai added, "You have a dog, a dog house, and children. Logically, you should get married!"
Dazed: "I've been married for a long time!"
Mr. Bai concluded: "From the above point of view, you should be a 'heterosexual'. This is the logic!"
Dazed: Oh, that's what it is, it seems quite interesting. "

Dazed said, "It's very simple, do you have a dog?"
Amin said, "You know I don't keep dogs."
Dazed said, "Oh, so you're gayâ€”"
