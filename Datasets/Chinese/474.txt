A few days ago, I met a beautiful and sexy sister on the Internet, and after chatting on the Internet, I felt very attached.
She asked me to go to her house and she said, "My husband is going on business tomorrow"
I was cautious and asked, "Will your husband come back suddenly?"
The girl said: "No, in case you come back, you can say: 'You are from the cleaning company, and the company sent you to do cleaning, cleaning glass, etc.
, Anyway, it's almost New Year's Eve, my husband won't doubt it. "

As a result, I went to my sister's house today and just sat down to drink boiled water when her husband came back and I haven't touched her hand yet...
I had to be silent, wiped the glass all morning, and also washed the toilet and bathroom. His husband was beside me to guide me in my work.
Before leaving, her husband asked, "How much?"
"It has been paid to the company," she said.

On the way home, the more I think about it, the more wrong I feel...
New Year's scams, beware...
