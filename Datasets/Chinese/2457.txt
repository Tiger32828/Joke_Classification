Mimler asked his friend Snyder, "You're studying in law school, can you tell me what the Talmud is?"
"Mimmel, let me explain to you with an example. May I ask you a question first?
If two Jews fell from a tall chimney, and one of them was covered in soot,
And the other is clean, so who of them will wash their bodies? "
"Of course it's the one with the dirty body!"
"You're wrong, that person looked at the person who didn't get dirty and thought, 'My body must be clean too!'
And a person with a clean body, seeing a person covered in soot, thinks that he may be as dirty as him. So, he's going to take a shower. "
"Damn it!" Mimler muttered. "I'm going to ask a second question. The two of them later fell into the tall chimney again - who's going to take a shower?" Snyder asked.
"I know now, it's the clean one!"
"No! You're wrong again, the person who is clean finds himself not too dirty when he takes a shower, and the person who is soiled is the opposite.
He understood why the clean man was going to take a bath, so this time he went to wash.
Let me ask you a third question. The third time the two of them fall down the chimney, who's going to take a shower? "
"Of course that's the one who got his body dirty!"
"No! You're still wrong! Have you ever seen two people fall down the same chimney, one clean and the other dirty?"
"..."
"This is the Talmud!"
