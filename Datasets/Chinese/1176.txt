Taking a taxi today, I told the driver to drive faster.
The driver drove to the point where I couldn't even see the people on the road, and dashed four red lights in a row.
Then I worriedly asked the driver, "Don't be in such a hurry, or you may have your driver's license revoked."
I saw the driver said calmly:

"Don't worry. I don't have a driver's license."
