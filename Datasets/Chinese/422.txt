Just now, Ah Hua's husband called and said that he was on the street and wanted to buy a bag for Ah Hua, and Ah Hua was overjoyed.
The husband came back and said that he didn't know what style Ah Hua liked, so he bought four styles together, saying that as long as Ah Hua was happy, it would be fine.
At that time, Ah Hua was excited, and hurriedly opened it to see one each of "bean paste buns, vegetable buns, meat buns, and red bean buns".
Now that I eat Ah Hua, I almost die.
