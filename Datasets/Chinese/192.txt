A rough guy ran into the bank and said to the lady at the counter, "I'm going to open a fucking account!"
Counter lady: "No problem, sir, but you don't need to use that tone..."
Rough guy: "ㄟ, hurry up, okay? Hurry up and help me fix this damn account, I'm in a hurry..."
The counter lady: "Sir, I'm not used to other people's tone..."
Rough guy: "ㄟ, don't waste my time, can you help me get a fucking account?"
Counter lady: "Sorry sir, I think I should ask our manager to come out..."
At this time, the lady at the counter ran into the manager's room to complain to the manager...
After a while, the manager comforted the young lady and then came out and reasoned with the rough man, "It seems that there is some trouble here, can you tell me what happened?"
Rough guy: "I just want to get a fucking account and save the fucking $100 million lottery jackpot I just won, okay?"
The bank manager immediately pointed at the counter lady and said, "I apologize to you on behalf of this bitch."
