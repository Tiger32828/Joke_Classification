A Ben, who had just been admitted to the Philosophy Department, was eager to show off what he had learned in class with his parents when he first came home.
During dinner, Aben saw two marinated eggs in the bowl, so he picked up one and asked his father, "How many marinated eggs are in the bowl now?"
Dad: "One."
Aben then put back the braised egg he picked up and asked, "What about now?"
Dad: "Two."
Aben: "So how many eggs are there in this bowl?"
Dad: "It's still two."
Aben said proudly: "No, there was one just now, and now there are two, and the total is three. This is called philosophy."
The mother on the side looked at it, and immediately said, "Although it is difficult to understand, it is also a good solution to the problem. My father and I are each one of the braised eggs. You can eat the philosophy's braised eggs!"
Aben: "..."
