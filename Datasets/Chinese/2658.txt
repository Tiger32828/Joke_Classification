Hemingway covets comfort, mostly reading or writing in bed.
One morning, a news reporter came to visit him, and Hemingway asked his wife to invite this man into his bedroom...
The wife stopped and said, "Shouldn't you get up? What does it look like you're lying on the bed by yourself and let others stand?"
He thought for a while, then agreed, "I didn't think about it, I think you'd better get the maid to make another bed!"
