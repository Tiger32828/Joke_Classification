A motorcycle came to a remote small mountain village, and the villagers had never seen such a strange guy.
They were staring, pinching, and screaming around it, when the most knowledgeable man in the village came.
He circled around the motorcycle for a long time, carefully observed various parts of the motorcycle, and then touched the exhaust pipe with his hand and said proudly: "This guy is a male!"
