The owner of the candy store pulled him to look at his store name: "Sugar Taizong", the welder was silent...
The owner of the cake shop not far away ran out and pointed to his shop name: "Han Cake Ancestor", the two were silent together...
At this time, a manure digger passed in front of the two of them riding a dung truck. Three big characters were written on the dung truck: "Catch the dung emperor"... There was a collective silence...
The news spread to Hunan that there was a craftsman who made bamboo mats, and he also had the whole sign hang outside the bamboo ware shop: "Mao Bamboo Mat"
