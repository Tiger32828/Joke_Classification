When he first entered the country, the school held an "Inter-Class Chorus Competition".
Because I wasn't familiar with the environment, I didn't "pre-walk" before the game, so after I got off the stage, I followed a boy in front of me.
Unexpectedly, I followed, and I actually followed into the men's toilet! Still "standing" behind him for a while!
As a result, bursts of laughter and ridicule were drawn - "Classmate, come watch the birds!"
