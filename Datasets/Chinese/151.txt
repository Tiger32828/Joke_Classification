The New Year is almost here, so it should be.
Xiao Hua, a good friend of Xiao Ming who is studying in kindergarten, is a big family, and Xiao Hua's father is the eldest son. Because of his successful career, all the family members plan to go to Xiao Hua's house to gather around the fireplace during the Chinese New Year. Xiao Hua's father's father has a total of 16 children. , because we have been separated for many years.
It was the first time I went to Xiaohua for a reunion, and Xiaoming also went to Xiaohua's house to play during the day on New Year's Eve. Just as we were having fun, a group of relatives of Xiaohua's family came in one after another, and a lot of children followed, so many that even Xiaohua's grandfather didn't know how many grandchildren inside and outside...
At this time, Xiaohua's little aunt said: Come and say Happy New Year to grandpa, all the children, everyone has a red envelope!
So a bunch of children lined up to pay New Year's greetings to grandpa to receive red envelopes, and Xiao Ming was also in the line. Every child said when they saw grandpa: "Happy New Year, grandpa!" Got the red envelope.
In the end, there was a child who didn't get it. Grandpa said it was strange. Didn't you say that there are 30 grandchildren, why would one pack less?
And who was the kid just now?
