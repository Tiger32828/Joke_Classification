The child who went to school on the first day cried very pitifully. The teacher asked him why, and he said, "I don't like school, but from now on I have to come to you every day until I am 15 years old."
The teacher comforted her and said, "I am more pitiful than you. I have to come here every day until I am 60 years old!"
