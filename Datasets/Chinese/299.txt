In the evening, my wife said to share the housework,
He asked me, "Which one do you choose between washing the dishes or mopping the floor?"
I said, "Wash the dishes."

After washing the dishes, the wife asked again, "Which one do you choose between washing children or mopping the floor?"
I said, "mopping the floor."

After mopping the floor, the wife asked again, "Which one do you choose to wash clothes or wash children?"
I said, "Wash the kids."

After washing the child, my wife asked me, "Which one do you choose to wash clothes and sleep with the child?"
I said, "Do the laundry."

After washing my clothes and seeing my wife and children falling asleep, I suddenly felt that something was wrong.
