Lao Wang went to eat beef noodles today and saw the writing on the wall:
"The cows are raised by themselves, the vegetables are grown by themselves, and the oil is fried by themselves. Please eat them with peace of mind."

Before leaving, when it was time to pay the bill, he whispered to the lady boss in her ear:
"This banknote is printed by myself, please accept it with peace of mind."
