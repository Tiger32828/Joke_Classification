My son is three years old this year. He already knows how to count from one to ten, and also knows that five is bigger than one.
Once, I asked him what three plus five equals. He didn't know, so I inspired him:
"If you eat three apples in the morning and five apples in the afternoon, how many apples do you eat in total?"
After thinking about it for a long time, my son suddenly said, "My mother won't let me eat so many apples, it will cause tooth decay!"
