Last winter, my wife and I went on vacation to the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State,
I really want to see the coastal rainforest. I heard that many roads are blocked by snow and cannot be passed.
Although I was scared, I drove the car.
"Sure enough, not long after I hit the road, I saw a sign saying, "There is ice ten miles ahead."
After five miles, another sign said, "Five miles ahead, there's ice."
The next sign said "Ice half a mile ahead".
We were almost crawling about half a mile.
Finally we see another sign hanging outside a small shop,
It reads: "A 50 cents cup of ice cream."
