A brothel closed down, auctioning off everything,

The young man bought a parrot raised in the yard and brought it home.
As soon as they got home, the parrot started talking: "The environment has changed, the environment has changed"

The young man's mother went to the living room after hearing this,
The parrot said, "The lady boss has changed, and the lady boss has changed."

After the young man's sister heard it, she also came to the living room,
The parrot said, "Miss also changed, and the lady changed too."
The young man's father also came to the living room, and the parrot shouted, "The old client has not changed, the old client has not changed!"
