Conversation between a man and a doctor
"Doctor, my wife and I are both black-haired, why do we give birth to a child with brown hair?"
"Do you make love every day?"
"Do not."
"Make love every week?"
"nor."
"Do you make love every month?"
"no."
"Once a half year?"
"Neither."
"Only once a year?"
"almost."
"That's right, your baby is rusted, that's why the child's hair is brown."
