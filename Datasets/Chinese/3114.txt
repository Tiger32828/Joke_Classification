The editor-in-chief of a French publishing house received a manuscript from a young girl one day, along with the original manuscript of the novel and a large box of marzipan.
After reading the manuscript, the editor-in-chief sent her a letter:
"Your marzipan was delicious, and we took it; but your novel was too bad, we couldn't take it. Just send the marzipan in the future."
