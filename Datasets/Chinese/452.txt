NASA is interviewing for the talent that will be sent to Venus, only one can go and probably won't be able to return to Earth.
The first candidate, an American engineer, was asked how much he wanted to be paid.
He replied: "One million, I'm going to donate the money to my alma mater."
The next candidate, a British doctor, was also asked the same question. He asked for two million: "I want to keep one million for my family, and one million for medical research funds."
When the third applicant, a Chinese student, was asked how much he wanted, he whispered in the interviewer's ear, "Three million."
The interviewer asked, "Why so much more than others?"

The Chinese student replied: "If you give me three million, I will give you one million, keep one million for myself, and we can send American engineers to Venus for the remaining one million."
