The captain approached a flight attendant who was reading a magazine and said:
"I ask you a question, if you can't answer it, you give me $5;
You ask me a question, and I can't answer it, I'll give you $100. "
The flight attendant put down the magazine and acquiesced.

The captain began to ask, "What is the cruise speed of the Boeing 747?"
The flight attendant thought about it for a while, then took out 5 yuan to the captain.
The captain asked proudly, "It's your turn."

The stewardess asked, "3 eyes, 4 noses, 5 mouths, 6 ears, and a long tail, what are they?"
The captain thought about it for a long time, but couldn't figure it out, so he took out 100 yuan to the flight attendant.
The flight attendant immediately put away the 100 yuan.

The captain felt very unconvinced and asked, "What's the answer?"
The flight attendant immediately took out 5 yuan to the captain, and then read the magazine again.
