One day, I bought a box of cold noodles at a certain 7-11,
There were many guests at that time.
When checking out at the counter .................
Clerk: "A total of 40 yuan. Do you want to microwave the cold noodles?"
Me: "............? No need, thank you!"
Everyone in the store laughed so hard,
At this time, there was a sound of singing from the stereo in the store: "It's good to have 7-11."
