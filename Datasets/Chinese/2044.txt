In one exercise, the commander repeatedly asked his subordinates beforehand that when the test officer arrives, the soldiers must cover up well, so that even if the sky falls, their whereabouts cannot be revealed.
Time flew by, and soon the exercise was coming. When everything went smoothly according to plan and was about to come to an end, a soldier suddenly rushed in front of the test officer and shouted "Help!"
When the commander saw it, he was very unhappy and asked, "I told you to cover up, why did you run out?"
Soldier: "Report Commander, I just hid in the bushes. At first, two ants ran into my trousers. Although it was very itchy, I tolerated it. Next, two spiders ran in to make a web. I also endured it, and finally ran into two squirrels, they were discussing which one to eat first, I couldn’t stand it, so I rushed out.”
