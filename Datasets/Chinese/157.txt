A friend took me to a famous restaurant for a duck dinner, and he told me that the dish was full of duck from start to finish.
Every time he served a dish, he explained to me: "This is honeyduck duck meat", "This is slot-steamed duck liver", "This is slippery duck loin"
The next dish I knew was chicken, I waited for him to explain, but my friend was silent.
Finally I asked him, "What is this?"
"Ah! This is the duck's friend," he replied confidently.
