One day, Xiao Ming scored 10 points in the exam, and Xiao Ming knew that he would be beaten by his father when he returned with such a score!
So he picked up the red pen and made a swipe on top of 10 points to become 70 points.
After that, Xiao Ming thought: "It's already 70 points, just don't do it again and again, it'll be 90 points ^^"
So Xiao Ming draws a circle on the score again, and the score becomes 90!

After that, Xiaoming went home and showed his results to his father. His father did not believe that Xiaoming could get such a high score on the test. Because his father knew Xiaoming too well, his father bought a "polygraph robot" and came back.
Dad said to Xiao Ming, "This robot will slap you if you lie."
After that, my father asked Xiaoming to tell me how much he scored in the test.

Xiao Ming said: "90 points"
Then there is a "pop"

Xiao Ming covered his left cheek and said, "70 points"
Then there is a "pop"

Xiao Ming covered his face and cried, "10 points"

Then Xiao Ming's father was furious: "I have never been so bad at your age!"
Then "papapa", Xiao Ming's father was beaten by the robot.

Then Xiao Ming's mother said: "You really are father and son"
And Xiao Ming's mother's words have not been finished, and the slaps are endless in an instant.
"Clap clap clap clap clap clap ~ ~"
