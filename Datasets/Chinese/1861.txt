At the end of the one-day exam, the professor had already instructed the students to hand in the papers, but a classmate was still writing quickly.
After the professor received the test paper, he ignored the classmate and walked out the door.
The classmate hurried to hand in the papers, but the professor wouldn't let him do it.
He immediately said, "Do you know who I am?"
Hearing this, the professor couldn't help but scolded: "I don't care who you are, even if your father is a legislator, so what?"
After listening to the students, they said, "That's good!"
Immediately insert the test paper into the center of the stack of test papers, turn around and run.
