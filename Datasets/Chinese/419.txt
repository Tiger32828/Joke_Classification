The woman went to the temple to pay homage to the Buddha in a tangled mood in order to seek peace of mind.
When the woman was about to leave after bowing to the Buddha, a master came to teach...

Master: Did you let it go?
Woman: Disciple put aside all kinds of troubles!

The master shook his head and asked again: Have you put it down?
Woman: Let go of your obsession!

The master shook his head again and asked: Have you put it down?
The woman felt that the master seemed to be playing a Zen machine, so she replied: Let go of myself!

The master shook his head and asked the same question again.
The woman gave a number of different answers, all of which were rejected.

The woman finally got discouraged and asked the master: Please ask the master to teach, what is there for the disciple to let go?
The master folded his hands together and said....... My Buddha is compassionate, "sesame oil money".
