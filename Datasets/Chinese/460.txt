A thief coveted a villa for a long time, and finally one day the family went on a trip.
The thief observed for 3 consecutive days and confirmed that the door of the villa was locked and no other people visited.

Just in the dark night, he pried the door, and walked into the room tentatively in the dark.
Just a few steps away, a voice came out of nowhere: "God is watching you!"

The thief was startled, but thought again, there must be no one in this house, is it an illusion?
After calming down, he continued to explore.
After taking a few steps, the voice came out from nowhere: "God is watching you!"

This time, the thief was alert and carefully observed, and found that it was a parrot in the bird cage.
I asked the parrot with confidence: "What's your name?"
The parrot replied: "My name is Wang Ba Lao Zi"
The thief said angrily, "Which bastard gave you such a name?"
The parrot replied with a smile: "My master! Oh, he even named the big wolf dog that guards the house God!"
Then only a scream was heard.
