The salon often encounters an old man who is fussy and eccentric, and all barbers suffer from his idleness.
One day when he was getting a haircut, he insisted on having his hair parted in the middle. The designer decided to straighten him out and said, "Sir, I really can't do it."
The old man growled: "Why can't you do it?"
The designer replied: "Because your hair is 'singular'."
