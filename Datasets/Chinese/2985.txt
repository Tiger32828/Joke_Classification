Prime Minister Zhang liked cursive script very much, but he didn't put much effort into practicing it. Everyone laughed at his poor calligraphy, but the Prime Minister didn't care.
One day, he accidentally drafted a good sentence, and immediately wrote a book, which can be said to be full of paper dragons and snakes flying.
After writing, he asked his nephew to transcribe it.
When the nephew started to copy, he was dumbfounded, unable to write.
He had to take the manuscript and ask the prime minister, "Uncle, I don't know the characters you wrote. Please tell me what characters are these?"
On the contrary, the prime minister looked at it for a long time, not even knowing himself, so he blamed his nephew and said, "Why didn't you come and ask me earlier? Now I also forget what I wrote?"
