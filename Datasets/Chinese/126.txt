One day, a zookeeper suddenly found that the kangaroos in the park ran out, so they held a meeting to discuss and agreed that the height of the cage was too low.
So they decided to increase the height of the cage from the original ten meters to twenty meters.
The next day, they found that the kangaroo was still outside, so they decided to increase the height to 30 meters.
Unexpectedly, they saw all the kangaroos running outside again the next day, so the administrators were very nervous and decided not to stop and raise the height of the cage to 100 meters.
One day the giraffe was chatting with a few kangaroos, "Do you think these people will continue to raise your cage?" the giraffe asked.
"It's hard to tell if they keep forgetting to close the door," said Kangaroo.
