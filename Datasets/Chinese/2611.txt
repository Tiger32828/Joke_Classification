A girl came to her boyfriend's house, and her boyfriend's mother was very enthusiastic and greeted them for dinner.
At the dinner table, she suddenly wanted to fart, but she only dared to do it secretly, with little force.
Suddenly his mother scolded the dog under the dining table, "Xiao Bai!"
The girl thought that his mother mistakenly thought that the fart was put by a dog, so she released it with more confidence.
His mother called again, "Xiao-Bai! If I tell you to come out, but if you don't come out, I don't care if you get smoked to death later!"
