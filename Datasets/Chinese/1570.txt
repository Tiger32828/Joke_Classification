Two old classmates who have been separated for many years meet by chance on the street.
A opened the mouth and said, "You must be married!" B was surprised how he knew.
A replied: "Look at how well your clothes are ironed, you were not like this before."
"Isn't it?" B said helplessly, "My wife asked me to iron it."
