Uncle Wang, who lives next door to my house, has a cute Pomeranian dog named "Xiao Bai".
One day when I was after school, I saw Uncle Wang bathing Xiaobai.
I immediately walked up to him and blurted out, "Xiao Bai, you're helping the dog take a bath!"
Uncle Wang was dumbfounded on the spot and asked me with a smile, "You treat me like a dog!"
Immediately it made me blush so blushing, it was so embarrassing at the time!
