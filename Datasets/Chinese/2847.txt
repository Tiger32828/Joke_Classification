At noon one day, I saw my friend eating colorful balls.
I felt very unhappy when I wanted it, but I "secretly" (Taiwanese, secretly) even had chocolate? It's so boring!
So, I ran over and grabbed one.......
"Chocolate! Give me one!"
"Wait a moment........."
"Don't be so stingy!"
Without giving him a chance to speak, I threw the small ball into my mouth. Hmm...weird smell...is it expired?
"That's my medicine!" the classmate shouted.
Ah! medicine? That's too late! It's already in my stomach....
