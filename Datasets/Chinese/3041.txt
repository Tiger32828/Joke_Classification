American pianist Polge, once, when he played in Flint City, Michigan, found that the audience was very small, less than half, and he was very disappointed in his heart.
At this time, I saw him walking to the front of the stage calmly, and said to the audience, "You people in Flint City must be very rich. I see that each of you has bought a two-seat ticket, which is amazing!"
As soon as the words fell, the audience burst into cheers.
