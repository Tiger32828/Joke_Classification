Aaron and Xiaowen went to the holiday villa they just bought. Unexpectedly, as soon as they opened the door, a black and big mouse ran past them, making Xiaowen pale.

Aaron: "I have thought about doing this, just to let it tell its peers that our house is not to be messed with, and if they pass through our house in the future, they all have to detour!"
