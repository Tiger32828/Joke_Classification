During World War II, Churchill and an upper-class lady quarreled over trivial matters, and scolded the other party as a pig in anger, and Mrs. Winston was very angry and sued the court.
After inquiring about the ins and outs, the judge ruled that it was Churchill's fault, and the sentence was to be fined two pounds and an apology.
Churchill can only obey _x0008_. …
He then questioned the judge: "It is a sin to call Mrs Winston a pig, and is it a sin to call a pig Mrs Winston?"
The judge replied, "So innocent!"
Churchill thanked the judge in a good mood and said to Mrs Winston, "Mrs Winston, good morning!" and left happily.
