Dear Son:

I am writing this letter very slowly, because I know that you are not fast at reading.
Your father and I have moved, but the address has not changed because we brought the house number with us when we moved.
It rained twice this week, the first for 3 days and the second for 4 days.
Yesterday we went to buy pizza, the clerk asked me if I wanted to cut into 8 slices or 12 slices, I said 8 slices is enough, 12 slices can't be eaten.
I sent you a jacket, and I cut the buttons off and put it in my jacket pocket because I was afraid it would be too heavy to mail.
You read later, remember to read more books and use idioms more, lest others laugh at you for not being good enough,
Finally, let me tell you that it is hard to find a job now, and you are full of monkeys and grandchildren. You originally wanted to send some money to you for the New Year's Eve, but unfortunately the envelope has been sealed.
