A husband and wife quarrel, the man can't win the woman's quarrel, they lie directly on the bed, motionless!

The man replied: "Dead!"
The woman asked again, "Why do you keep your eyes open when you're dead?"
Male: "I can't rest my eyes!"
The woman asked again, "Then why are you still breathing?"
The man said, "I can't take this breath!"
