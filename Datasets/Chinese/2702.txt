Two Hungarians discuss "mutual economic assistance" of the Soviet-Russian bloc.
The first Hungarian asked: "What do they mean by 'mutual aid'?"
The second Hungarian replied: "We helped Soviet Russia by loading our material onto the train in Hungary, and they helped us by removing it from the train in Moscow."
