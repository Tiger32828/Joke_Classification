A staff member has been out of work for two days. When he came to the company on the third day, Boss Guo complained, "What have you been doing these two days?"
The clerk replied, "I accidentally fell from the third-floor window onto the street."
Boss Guo angrily asked, "Does it take two days to fall from the third floor?"
