One day, five Japanese, Americans, Chinese, Koreans, and Taiwanese took a plane together.
As a result, the plane encountered turbulence and was about to crash.
At this time, the Japanese said, "What should I do? There are only four sets of skydiving!"
At this time, the Taiwanese kicked the Koreans down and said casually:


"Don't worry! Gravity was invented by them anyway."
