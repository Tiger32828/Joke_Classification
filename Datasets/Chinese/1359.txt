Xiaoying is a little girl who is in the third grade of elementary school. I usually like to use my mother's makeup to wipe things around.
One day, Xiaoying's teacher asked everyone what they wanted to do when they grew up, and everyone had to stand up and express their ideas;
When it was Xiaoying's turn, the teacher asked her like: "Xiaoying! Tell the class aloud, what is your ambition to grow up in the future? 』
Xiaoying thought for a while and said, "In the future, when I grow up, if I have big breasts, I will be a movie star. 』
The teacher asked curiously, "Then...Xiaoying, if your breasts are not big, what are you going to do? 』
Xiaoying said, "If my breasts are not big....then I'll have to be like you...be a teacher! 』
