The boys and girls are having a paintball contest!
Each side has a flag and planted in their respective areas,
The flag of one side is knocked down and the other side wins,
In the last ten minutes of the game, the flags of both sides remained indifferent.
Now, it's time to take out the trash.
A garbage truck drives past, and the man wins!
