A: "Long time no see!"
B: "I was arrested and imprisoned for 90 days a while ago."
A: "Why?"
B: "You know I was dating a widow a while ago, and she actually accused me of rape, but when he told the judge that my ability and performance were the best in the world, I pleaded guilty."
A: "Then you are only sentenced to ninety days in prison for rape, which is considered a very light sentence."
B: "The judge thinks my punishment is not rape, but perjury."
