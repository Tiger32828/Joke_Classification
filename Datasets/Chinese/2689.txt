Annie: "What did you buy for your husband's birthday?"
Judy: "I knew he needed a diary, so I bought him a diary with a lock on it. I know his temper, and the diary he wrote was very careful, and it was never easy for people to read."
Annie: "So, did you also buy something for your own use?"
Judy: "Oh! Yes, I'll buy an extra key."
