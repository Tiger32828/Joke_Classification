An American cigarette dealer came to France to do business. One day, he talked about the benefits of smoking at the market.
Suddenly, an old man came up to the stage and said loudly: "Ladies and gentlemen, smoking has three advantages: first, dogs are afraid of smokers; second, thieves dare not steal from others; third, smokers are forever young ‚Äù

For a time, the audience in the audience was excited, and the businessman was even more delighted.
But the old man waved his hand and said, "Why? Because... First, there are so many people who smoke hunchbacks, and the dog sees it and thinks that he is about to pick up stones to hit him. Cough, the thief thought he didn't sleep and didn't dare to steal. Third, people who smoke are short-lived, so they are forever young."
