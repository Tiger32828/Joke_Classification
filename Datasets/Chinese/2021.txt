One day, when it was time for dinner, whenever there was a phone call, it was answered by the seven-year-old son and the little concubine who came as a guest.
When a phone rang, the little concubine answered, only to see him transfer the call to his son in confusion.
The son replied, "There is no such person in my family."
Then he laughed and told me, "That man is so strange, he wants to find Alibaba!"
The phone rang again, and my son said that it was the same person who was looking for Alibaba, so I took it and listened to it.
It turned out that the person who repaired the electrical appliance asked, "Ah, is your father there?"
