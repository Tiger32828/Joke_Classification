Teacher: Your son fell in love at school.
Parent: I know!
Teacher: You don't object?
Parent: What is the objection? He has his girlfriend in charge of him at school, doesn't let him smoke or drink, takes care of him when he is sick, and reminds him to wear more clothes when it's cold, that's great~

Teacher: Does that mean we agree to be together?
