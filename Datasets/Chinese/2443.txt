British scientist Charlie Rob Darwin (1809-1882) was a guest at the home of an old friend who lived in seclusion in the countryside.
The two children of a friend deliberately took the opportunity to tease the eminent scientist. They caught a butterfly, a grasshopper, a beetle,
A centipede, then the body of the centipede, the wings of the butterfly, the thigh of the grasshopper, the head of the beetle,
Carefully pieced together and glued together into a grotesque little insect with strange limbs. Then they put it in a box and brought it to Darwin.
"We caught this insect in the field. Mr. Darwin, can you tell us what kind it is?"
Darwin glanced at it, then glanced at the children again, and said with a smile, "Children, have you noticed: do they bark when they are caught?"
"It will bark," they answered; arm-mouthed to each other. "In that case," Darwin said, "it was a 'call' bug."
