The younger son suddenly asked his father one day, "Dad, did your father beat you when you were a child?"
"Of course, he hit me," his dad said.
"So, did his dad beat him when he was a kid?"
"Of course, his dad hit him," Dad said with a smile.
The younger son thought for a while and said to his father:
"Dad, if you'll cooperate with me, we can stop this vicious cycle of violence."
