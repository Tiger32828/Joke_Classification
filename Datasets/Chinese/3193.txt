A traveler walks into a historic hotel and asks for a single room charge.
The service staff replied, "Five yuan per room on the second floor, forty yuan on the third floor, and thirty yuan on the fourth floor."
The traveler thought for a while, said thank you, and turned to leave.
The clerk said, "Don't you like our hotel?"
"Oh, it's beautiful," said the traveler, "just not tall enough."
