On the bus yesterday, I saw a young mother breastfeeding the baby in front of me, but the baby has not been cooperative.
The young mother threatened the child: "Do you eat it? If you don't eat it, I will eat it for the uncle next to you!"
After talking a few times, after two stops, the uncle next to him said, "Little boy, if you don't eat, just say it. Uncle will get off after two stops!"
