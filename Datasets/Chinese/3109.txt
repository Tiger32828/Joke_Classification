A fool wanted to eat pork, but he didn't know how to eat it, so he went to the butcher's shop to ask for advice.
The man in the butcher shop replied, "Chop it with a knife, cook it and eat it."
"Where can I buy a knife?"
"Buy it at the knife shop."
So the fool bought a knife in the knife shop. He holds the knife in his right hand and the meat in his left,
Walking in the street. Unexpectedly, just out of the city, a vulture flew down from the sky and grabbed the meat.
The fool didn't chase after him, but raised his head and smiled: "Haha! You stupid vulture. You don't have a knife, take the meat and let me see how you eat it!"
