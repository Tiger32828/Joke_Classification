An advertisement in an American newspaper fifty years ago: "Buy Pratt & Whitney Tooth Powder,
This tooth powder is better than the other brands sold in our store, and it's not worse than them.
That's why I especially recommend this tooth powder because it's made by my nephew.
The nephew is a young man who deserves help, and he hopes to get married by selling tooth powder. "
