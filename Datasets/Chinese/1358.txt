In a church, there is a priest and four little nuns; on the eve of a weekend, the four little nuns try to get the priest to spend the night in the town, but the premise is that they must report everything they have done the next day. .
The next morning, the priest said to the four little nuns, "Come on, if you did anything last night that you shouldn't have done, now repent to God and ask him to forgive you."

The first little nun said, "Lord! I was wrong, I read a pornographic magazine yesterday!"
The priest raised his head and thought for a moment, then said, "Okay, God has forgiven you, go and drink some holy water!"
The first little nun left happily, but the last little nun pursed her lips and snickered.

The second little nun followed and said, "Lord! I was wrong. I drove a puppy to death yesterday."
The priest raised his head and thought for a while before saying, "Okay! God has forgiven you too, let's go and drink some holy water!" But the last nun laughed even happier!

The third little nun went on to say, "Lord! I was wrong. I went to a dancer's strip show yesterday."
The priest raised his head again and thought for a while, and said, "Okay! I think God has forgiven you, let's drink some holy water in the past!" At this time, the fourth little nun fell to the ground with laughter;

The priest said unhappily, "Okay, now it's your turn. What did you do yesterday? So funny?"
The last little nun smiled and said, "Report to God, I was wrong too, I spilled a pee in holy water yesterday..."
