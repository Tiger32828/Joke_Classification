One day, I failed the nickname test,
I went home and said to my mother, "I want to drink pesticides to commit suicide!"
But my mother was singing Taiwanese songs and didn't have time to talk to him,
Mom said, "Drink, drink, don't leak!"
Xiao Ming said, "Mom! I'm going to jump off the building!"
At this point, her mother sang again: "Jump down, jump down, everyone rejoices!"
Xiao Ming said angrily, "Mom! Am I your son?"
Her mother sings again, "No...no...not you!"
