In other words, the president of a certain country suffered from a brain disease, and the doctor concluded that the brain must be replaced to cure it.
So the next day, the president brought in the Secretary of Education...

The President: "You are the highest education chief in the country. I wonder if you have anything suitable for that?"
Minister: "Yes, we have a bunch of college students' brains, and a kilogram costs 10,000 yuan."

President: "Why is it so expensive?"
Minister: "Because college students seldom use their brains to think about things these days, their brains are almost brand new, and the price is naturally a little higher."

President: "Apart from college students, is there any other kind?"
Minister: "The brains of professors in universities and research institutes cost 5,000 yuan per kilogram."

The President: "What's the difference between this and the one just now?"
Minister: "Most of the professors' brains are very old, so they can be considered cheap."

THE PRESIDENT: "Anything else?"
Minister: "Of course! The brains of legislators are worth five million yuan per kilogram."
President: "Wow! It's so expensive? It's a scam!"

Minister: "Expensive!?! Expensive there? Do you know how many legislators it takes to collect a kilo?"
