One day, a math teacher in the south gave a question to his classmates: "A train travels sixty miles an hour, and a snail crawls ten feet in the same time."
The master asked: "Students, from this question, please calculate my age."
The students were stumped, but to the teacher's surprise, one of the students stood up and said, "You are sixty-six years old."
"Yes," said the teacher, "I happen to be sixty-six years old. Please tell your classmates how you calculated it."
The student replied, "I have a brother at home. He is thirty-three years old. He is crazy. You must be sixty-six because you are twice as crazy."
