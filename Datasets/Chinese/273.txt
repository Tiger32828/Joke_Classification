A woman carried BABY to an obstetrics and gynecology department.
The doctor asked the woman, "Does BABY eat breast milk or cow's milk?"
Woman: Eat breast milk!
Doctor: Then please take off your clothes.
Woman: Ah! ? Why?
Doctor: Please don't be nervous, this is the obstetrics and gynecology department, and it will never violate you in any way.

The woman took off her shirt suspiciously. The doctor used his hand to touch the woman's chest, rub it down, rub it left, rub it right. Say to this woman: No wonder BABY is malnourished, you don't have breast milk at all!
Woman: Nonsense! Of course I don't breastfeed; I'm his auntie!
