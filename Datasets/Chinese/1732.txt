The patient complained to the doctor about the distress of not being able to sleep.
The doctor saw that several prescriptions were ineffective, so he had to teach the original treatment: "You keep counting until you reach 3,000, and come back to me in a few days."
The next time we meet, the patient is still sad and depressed.
"Doctor, I still can't sleep. As you said, I insisted on counting. When I reached 1786, I was really sleepy, so I drank a cup of coffee to refresh myself, and then I counted to 3000. But this time, I can't sleep again."
