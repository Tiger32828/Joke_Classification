Kangkang and his girlfriend An Qi are on a date in Daan Park. The two are sitting on chairs and chatting about some trivial things in life...
Suddenly, An Qi asked in a very embarrassed tone: "Kangkang, what are you thinking about now?"
Kangkang thought that his mouth was very sweet: "It's nothing, "I think the same as you think"!"
Suddenly, there is a "pop"!
An Qi gave Kang Kang a big slap and yelled, "You... you pervert! Pervert!"
Kangkang: "...???"
