One day, because I had a lot of fun singing in music class, I rocked the chair while singing.
Although I knew that if the chair was shaken too much, it might break, but I was in a high mood and forgot about it.
As a result, when everyone was singing happily, suddenly there was a sound of "Boom! Boom!" The chair had already been shaken to pieces by me!
The whole class was looking at me, and even I was so frightened that I didn't know what to do!
Suddenly, someone burst out laughing, and then the whole class burst into laughter, even the teacher. So embarrassing!
