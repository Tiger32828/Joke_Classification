There was a soldier who had just enlisted, and one night it was his turn to stand guard.
Suddenly, the company commander came by, and he looked like he wanted to make a public phone call!
Xiaobing watched the company commander stroking his body for a while, as if he couldn't find any change. He turned his head and saw him.
"Hello company commander!" The soldier said hello.
"Okay. You...do you have a dollar on you now? The company commander is in a hurry and must call."
"Yes~ Company Commander, fortunately I have it, or else you would be in a panic?)"
The company commander was furious when he heard that someone dared to speak to him with such an attitude.
"Is this your attitude to talk to the superior? I'll ask you again, do you have a dollar on you?"
The soldier stood up at once and answered with dignity and solemnity:
"Report to the company commander, no!"
