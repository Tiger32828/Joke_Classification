The father and son went back after selling things at the night market. On the way there was a robber who pointed his gun at the young man: "Put the money down!"
The old man touched the robber and shouted to his son, "Run!"
The robber said, "You old fellow don't die!"
"Yes, shoot! I have accident insurance!"
