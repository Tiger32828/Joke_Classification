Once, Bai Bingbing drove her assistant to the gas station to refuel,
As soon as the window opened, her hat was blown away by the wind.
She said to the assistant, "I'm going to pick up the hat, you cheer me on."
Then she got out of the car to chase the hat that was blown away by the wind, and her assistant also got out of the car,
In the back, he applauded and beat the beat: "Come on, come on, come on, Sister Bingbing, come on!"
