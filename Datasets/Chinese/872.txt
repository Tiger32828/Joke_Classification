There is an elephant in the palace, and this elephant will make all kinds of expressions of joy, anger, sorrow and joy.
One day, the elephant was in a daze for several weeks.

The king became anxious, he posted a notice,
It reads: "If anyone can make my elephant cry, I will reward him with a million and marry the princess to him."

There really is a young man going! He kicked the elephant's genitals!
The elephant cried, and the king was not convinced.

He told him that if he could make the elephant nod and shake his head, he would give him one million, so he whispered to the elephant.
The elephant nodded and shook his head, and the king was surprised and asked how he did it?

He said, "It's very simple! I just asked him, "Does it hurt just now?" He nodded wildly, and I asked him again, "Do you want to do it again?" He shook his head violently!"
