There are rooms on a certain floor that are rented out to multiple men and women,
It happened that there was only one bathroom on that floor, so the bathroom had to be shared, and it took a long time to line up to take a shower.
One day, Xiao Ming came back from work and wanted to take a bath, but a woman happened to be washing in the bathroom.
Xiao Ming asked: Miss, is anyone washing down below you?
Miss: I will wash it myself next! boring!
Xiao Ming asked again: Miss...I didn't mean that...I mean, is there someone behind you to wash?
Miss: I will wash it myself later! abnormal!
Xiao Ming is helpless: Miss, I really didn't mean that! I mean to say...
The lady shouted: ÈΩÅ! Come in if you want! So much to say............
