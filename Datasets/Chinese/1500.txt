A hunter went hunting with his hounds and walked in the woods for a day without any prey.
It was getting dark, and he was still unwilling to ride around in the woods, and the horse suddenly said, "You don't let me rest, you want to kill me!?"
The hunter was startled when he heard it, so he immediately rolled off the horse and ran away with the hunting dog. When he ran to a large tree to catch his breath, the dog patted him on the chest and said, "It scared me to death, the horse can actually speak!"
So the hunter was scared to death on the spot.
