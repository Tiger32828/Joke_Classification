A fool's wife woke up dizzy in the morning, so the fool went to town to buy medicine, but he didn't know what to call the pharmacist in the pharmacy, so he pulled someone and asked.
That person bullied him dumbfounded, making fun of him and saying that it was enough to call him Doctor Mongolia.
The fool then went to the pharmacy counter and said loudly, "Doctor Mongolia, give me medicine for dizziness."
When the pharmacist heard this, he thought that the fool was here to make trouble, and slapped him twice on the head angrily and told him to go back.
The fool thought the heavy second hit was a prescription, so he hurried back and knocked hard on his wife's head in the same way.
When the fool saw it, he thought it would be a pity to waste such a powerful medicine. He hurried back to town and said to the pharmacist, "Your medicine is really good, and I will give you the remaining half."
After speaking, he hit the pharmacist hard on the head.
