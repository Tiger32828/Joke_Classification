A female customer was smoking in the department store, and a manager came to stop it: "Please don't smoke in the department store!"
The female customer disagreed: "Then why do you still sell cigarettes in your shopping mall?"
The manager replied politely, "We still sell condoms here. Would you like to do it on the spot?"
