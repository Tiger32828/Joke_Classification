On the bus today, an aunt came up. I got up and gave her a seat.
My aunt smiled and asked me, "How old are you?"
I said, "It's 27."
The aunt said: "I'm 27 and still crowding the bus! My daughter has bought a car at 22."
I smiled awkwardly: "Ha, I saved some money and bought a car for my mother at the beginning of this year. When my mother is too old, I can't let her squeeze the bus to buy food, do you think so?"
