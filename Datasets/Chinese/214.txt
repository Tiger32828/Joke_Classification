Once upon a time there was a very rich old man, but he was very snobby.
He has a rich daughter, and he always thinks that only rich people are qualified to marry his daughter.

One day, three boys came to ask for marriage, and of course the snobby old man had to question their worth.
A said, "I have ten million yuan in savings."
The old man felt very satisfied, but he wondered if the latter two would be more valuable. So continue to listen to what the next person has to say.

B said: "I have three houses, and I am the owner of a company."
Hmm...., the old man happily thinks it's better than the previous one, but also wants to see if the third place will be richer.
So he asked, "What do you have, sir?"

Bingmin said shyly, "I have a child."
The old man was furious when he heard this: "People who have children still want to marry my daughter. Come on, drive him out."
C hurriedly explained, "But that child is in Ling Ai's belly!"
