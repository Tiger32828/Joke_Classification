On this day, Coolidge was burying his head in his office when suddenly a lady who admired Coolidge broke in.
He congratulated him on his speech the day before and said, "It was so crowded in the hall that day that I couldn't find a seat at all, and I just stood there and listened to your speech."
The lady said this in an aggrieved tone, obviously wanting to exchange it for a few words of comfort.
Unexpectedly, Coolidge said indifferently, "You weren't the only one affected. I also stood there that day."
