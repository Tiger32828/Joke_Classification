On the street, a man with oily hair and flour noodles has been staring at a beautiful woman.
The woman suddenly turned to the man: "Why are you staring at me all the time?"
"You are so beautiful, I love you!" said the man. "I'm not beautiful, my sister is behind, she is beautiful."
The man immediately turned to look back, but saw an old woman.
"You lied to me!" the man shouted after catching up with the woman.
The woman smiled coldly: "You lie to me first!"
