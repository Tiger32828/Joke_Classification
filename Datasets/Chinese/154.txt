Once upon a time there was a king who had a beautiful daughter, a princess~
But the problem is that everything will melt as long as the princess touches it, whether it is metal, wood, or plastic, as long as she touches it, it will melt!
Because of this, men are very afraid of her, and no one dares to marry her.
This king is really desperate, how can he help his daughter?
He discussed what to do with the wizards, and one of the wizards told him, "If your daughter touches something and it doesn't melt in her hands, she'll be cured without medicine!"

The king was overjoyed to hear this,

So the next day, he held a game,
The rule is: Any man who can get hold of what does not melt in his daughter's hands can marry her daughter and inherit all his wealth.

Three young princes came to challenge.

The first one was a very hard titanium alloy,
But as soon as the princess touched it, it melted, and the prince left with great sadness.

The second prince took a huge diamond. He thought that since diamonds are the hardest thing in the world, they will not melt.
But as soon as the princess touched it, it melted, and the prince left with great sadness.

The third prince stepped forward and told the princess, "Please put your hand in my pocket and feel what is in it."
The princess followed his instructions and put her hand in his pocket, but her face turned red with shyness, she touched something hard, but it didn't melt in her hand! ! !

The king was very happy, everyone in the kingdom was very happy, and the third prince married the princess as he wished, and lived happily ever after.

The issue is,
What the hell is in the prince's pants?



Of course it's M&Ms! "It only melts in your mouth, not in your hands!"
Otherwise what are you thinking?
