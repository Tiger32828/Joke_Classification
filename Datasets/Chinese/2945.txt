A French publisher wants to boost his status by getting praise from famous writers.
He thought that in order to gain the goodwill of a big man, he must first be praised and praised.
On this day, he went to visit a well-known writer.
When he saw a review of Balzac's novels on the writer's desk, he said:
"Ah, sir, you're commenting on Balzac again. Indeed, over the years, there have been very few people who have really understood Balzac's works. After all, there are only two."
The writer understood the publisher's intention as soon as he heard it, and let him continue.
"One of these two people is you. But what about the other? Who do you think he should be?" the publisher meant.
The writer said: "It was, of course, Balzac himself."
