In the 1980s, when Deng Xiaoping visited the United States and held a press conference, the translator happened to be absent.
The American reporter wanted to test Deng Xiaoping's English proficiency, so he said:
What was the name of the first president of the United States?
Deng Xiaoping thought that according to the Chinese custom, one should ask the surname first,
With a Sichuan accent, he said:
My last name is Deng (Washington).

The American reporter was taken aback, but on second thought, the question was too simple, and he added:
Excuse me, what did your wife and children do in the United States?
Deng Xiaoping wanted to ask his surname again, it was time to ask his name, so he replied:
Xiaoping (shopping)

The reporters quickly asked: So what means of transportation did they use?
According to Chinese custom, Deng Xiaoping thought that they were asking about age, so he replied:
Eighty (bus).

The reporter was in an uproar and continued to ask:
So who will be the next president of Taiwan?
Deng Xiaoping came and went, but before the interpreter came, he replied:
You wait (Lee Teng-hui).

The reporter was in an uproar again, how could such a sensitive political question be answered so easily?
Then he asked again: What about behind Lee Teng-hui?
Deng Xiaoping was a little impatient and said:
Whatever (water flat).

When the reporters saw that the translation was coming, they took the time to ask the last question:
What do you think is the biggest problem facing the world in the early 21st century?
Deng Xiaoping was extremely impatient, wondering why these American journalists were so ignorant,
After asking endlessly, he lowered his face and asked:
What's the matter (SARS)?

More than 20 years later, an American reporter said with emotion:
Deng Xiaoping is really a great man of a generation, and it is expected that things are so accurate. . . . . . . .
