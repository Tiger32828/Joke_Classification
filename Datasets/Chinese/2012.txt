A wife accompanied her husband to see a doctor. After seeing the doctor, the doctor asked her husband to leave first.
Then he said to his wife, "If you treat your husband a little better, let him stretch out his hand for tea and open his mouth for food, don't let him have any troubles, don't get angry, everything should go according to his wishes, so your husband will have a few years left. Live or die soon."
Then the wife came out of the consultation room, and the husband asked with concern, "What's the matter, what did the doctor tell you?"
Wife: "The doctor said: You are dying."
