There is a couple who have been married for many years, and the husband always forgets some important days.
On their thirty-fifth wedding anniversary, while they were having breakfast, the wife hinted to her husband, "Wife, do you know that we have been sitting in these two chairs for thirty-five years?"
The husband put down the newspaper, looked at his wife and said, "Do you want to change seats with me?"
