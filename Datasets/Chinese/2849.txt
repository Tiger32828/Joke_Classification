From the beginning, I have been a "wire head".
Later, a classmate told me that she washed her hair with eggs, and her hair became better! So I was very happy to try her little recipe at home.
As a result, when rinsing, the eggs are...cooked!
Dead classmate, why didn't you tell me that you can't wash it with hot water?
