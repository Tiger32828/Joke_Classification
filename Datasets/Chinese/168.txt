A new recruit had just left the army, and the squad leader called him over for questioning.
Monitor: I would like to know, what expertise do you have?
Recruit: Report to the squad leader, there are only two things I can't do!
Principal: Oh! so smart! Well, tell me which two things won't!

Recruit: Report to the squad leader, I won't be able to "this way" nor "that way"!
