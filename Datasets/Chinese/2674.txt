Bella was smoking in the first-class car while traveling, and was rudely interfered by a passenger, Bella scolded him for being rude, and still smoked and ignored him. The guest was very angry and went to get the captain.
Driver: "Why are you smoking in the carriage and still not accepting advice?"
Bella continued smoking a cigarette as if nothing had happened and said to the driver: "Let's not say anything else, please check his ticket first!"
When the guest timidly took out his ticket, it was actually a second-class ticket, so he was immediately invited to the second-class car. Do you know that the passenger's ticket is second class?"
Bella: "It's very simple. I can see from his transparent clothes pocket that the color of his ticket is different from mine."
