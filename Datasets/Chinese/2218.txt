The child is a monk
Protected along the way, sometimes they do not distinguish between good and bad, loyal and wicked.

Mom is like Sun Wukong
Thankful for the hard work, bumpy road all the way, not afraid of difficulties, eating and drinking Lazard full burden.

Elders are like sand monks
Giving silently without expecting anything in return.

Dad is like a pig
No use, just know to eat.
If you're not careful, you might be seduced by a banshee!
