Confused magistrate was drunk and confused all day long. This afternoon, after he finished drinking a pot of wine, he was about to ask the yamen to give him another drink, when suddenly someone outside complained.
He was very annoyed, and after he was promoted to the hall, he ordered the yamen to take the board and beat the foe.
When the yamen asked how much to beat, he drunkenly stretched out three fingers and said, "Three more pounds."
