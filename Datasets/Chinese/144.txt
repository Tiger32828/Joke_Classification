When two men passed through the African desert in a hot air balloon, the balloon suddenly fell, and the two jumped out of the hot air balloon safely. They walked in the desert for two days before they encountered the oasis. The two quickly ran to the water source next to the oasis. There was a sign next to the water source with a paragraph of text written on it: "Warning: water drinkers are executed! Chief characters"
The two had been thirsty for two days, and they didn't care about drinking water. At this time, a group of natives suddenly appeared and tied the two together and took them back to the tribe to meet the chief.
The chief said: "I usually order you to cook and eat, but today is my birthday. If anyone can come back with a hundred fruits, I will consider letting them go."
The two were obedient and were taken separately to find fruit. The first man brought back a hundred wild cherries, and the chief ordered him to put the hundred wild cherries into his own ass one by one without laughing, so he spared him.
This man obediently stuffed the wild cherries into his own ass one by one. He didn't laugh at fifty, and he didn't laugh at ninety, but he laughed when the last one was left.
The natives asked suspiciously: "A cherry can save you from death, why do you still laugh?"
The man smiled and replied, "Haha...ha...look, my friend...ha...he brought back a hundred...haha...big watermelons"
