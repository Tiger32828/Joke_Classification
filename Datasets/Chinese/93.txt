Once I went out to play, I stayed at a distant relative's house for two days.

There is a custom there that children's urine is the cleanest, and they boil eggs with children's urine, which is said to be very healthy.

Where can I dare to eat it, but I can't help but people are enthusiastic and keep persuading me to eat.. to eat.. to eat. I have no choice but to say: I don't like eggs.

My relatives are even cuter, so you can drink some soup.
