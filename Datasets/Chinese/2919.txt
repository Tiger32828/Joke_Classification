An old gentleman said when he was ninety years old that he wished he and his wife his age could share a few more years of life.
"I want to live to be one hundred and twenty," he explained, "and I want my wife to live to be one hundred and nineteen."
"Why is there such a difference?"
"Because," he said, "I want to live a quiet year."
