Mother's Day is coming, my daughter wants to buy a gift for her mother.

Daughter: Mom, let me buy you a vacuum cleaner, so you don't have to bend over to sweep the floor.
Mom: No, it's a waste of money.
Daughter: Then I will buy you a dishwasher, which will save you a lot of trouble.
Mom: No, it's a waste of money.
Daughter: Then what do you want?
Mom: Don't want anything, these things, your dad usually does a good job.
