I work in the Military Intelligence Service, and one day, my colleague asked me to rush a report, only to find that there was only a piece of typing paper left at the base.
In a hurry, he went to the photocopying room of the base to ask the soldier on duty for paper for the copier, but he refused.
The reason is that it is illegal to assign paper for the copier, and he can only make copies for us.
So my colleague took out the blank typing paper and asked him to make a hundred copies.
