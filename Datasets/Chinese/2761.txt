"I have three daughters, and I hope to marry them off smoothly."
An old man said confidently to a strange young man:
"I've saved a lot of money, so she won't come to her husband's house without a dowry.
Let's say Atris, twenty-five years old, she's a good girl, and I'm going to give her a thousand dollars when she gets married.
Next up is Lenice, she's almost thirty-five, and I'm going to give her $2,000.
Uma is almost forty years old, whoever wants to marry her, I will give five thousand dollars. "
The young man thought for a while and asked the old man, "Do you have a daughter in her fifties?"
