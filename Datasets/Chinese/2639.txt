"Women?" a young man on the bus said to his companions. "Don't talk to me about women! I'm harassed by them every day, and I can't afford to be alone. Old maids, newly married women. The beautiful young ladies all bee around me. But I don't even have time to look at them."
When the bus stop arrived, he finally got off the bus and left.
There were two young ladies who were sitting in their neighborhood, listening to him with astonishment.
So when he was gone, one of them asked his companions, "Forgive me, I couldn't help overhearing that gentleman. Please tell me, he's a movie star?"
The man laughed.
"No, ma'am," he replied, "he's an elevator attendant for a certain company."
