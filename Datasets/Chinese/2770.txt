An ophthalmologist has successfully cured a famous surrealist painter's eye disease.
When charging, the doctor said that he could not charge, but hoped that the painter would paint a picture for him, and the content should be chosen by the painter himself.
The painter was very grateful to the doctor for curing his eye disease, so he painted a huge eye, every detail was meticulous, and painted a perfect portrait of the doctor in the center of the pupil.
When the ophthalmologist saw this painting, he was shocked by the artist's extraordinary artistic expression.
He opened his mouth wide in surprise before saying, "Thank goodness, I'm not an anal doctor."
