In our military academy in India, two cadets ran naked and were caught. The military law does not expressly stipulate that this kind of behavior is illegal.
The lieutenant didn't know what to do. Finally found the answer: he wrote in the report that the two trainees were attracted to mosquito bites because they were not wearing clothes.
They can then be charged with "violating the current order of the military region - non-compliance with the preventive measures against malaria".
