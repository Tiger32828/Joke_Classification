A man had a massive blood transfusion to his girlfriend because of a traffic accident.
Later, the two fell out, and her boyfriend insisted on recovering the blood debt.
In anger, his girlfriend pulled out a sanitary napkin and smashed it on his face!
The girlfriend yelled:

"This is the down payment, and I will pay you back on time every month!"
