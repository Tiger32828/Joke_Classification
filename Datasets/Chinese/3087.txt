Germans, French and a Russian got together to talk about "happiness".
The German said: "Happiness is when you lie down on your comfortable sofa, drink a beer and watch a great game after a hard day's work..."
The French said: "Happiness is that Saturday night, you spend a romantic evening with the blond you have long admired..."
At this time, the Russian said: "The real happiness is that in the middle of the night, you suddenly heard a hurried knock on the door, opened the door and saw a group of secret police officers pointed their guns at you and said, 'Grajiv? You're under arrest!" And you told them: "Grajiv lives next door!""
