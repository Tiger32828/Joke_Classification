The Beijing New Airport is at the junction of Wuqing, Daxing and Langfang. There were differences in the discussion at the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei government meeting around the naming of the new airport in Beijing:

Tianjin wanted to call Wuqing Airport, but Beijing disagreed;
Beijing wants to call Daxing Airport, but Hebei disagrees;
Hebei wanted to call Langfang Airport, but neither Beijing nor Tianjin agreed;

After friendly negotiation between the governments of the three places, combined with the characteristics of Chinese culture, the three parties finally reached an agreement, and the new airport was named: Wudalang Airport.
For security reasons, the airport does not have a west gate!
