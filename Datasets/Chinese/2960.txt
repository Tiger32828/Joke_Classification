The son is a primary school student.
On this day, as soon as he came home from school, he asked, "Dad, do you have the ability to write on paper with your eyes closed?"
"Good boy, what's so hard about it? Just write a few lines with your eyes closed!"
"There's no need to write a few lines. Dad, close your eyes now and sign this report card!"
