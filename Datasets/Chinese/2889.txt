Once, the famous Russian circus harlequin actor Durov held an observation performance, and in the middle of the performance, an audience unreasonably attacked Durov: "As a harlequin in a circus, as long as you have a stupid and ugly face, you will be punished. What about the audience's welcome?"
"I think so," Durov replied lightly. "If I could have a face like yours, sir, I'd definitely get a double salary!"
