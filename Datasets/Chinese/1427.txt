An old man went to the doctor and told the doctor that he had a stomach problem.
The doctor asked him, "Is your stool regular?"
The old man said, "It's very regular. Every morning, I defecate on time at eight o'clock."
The doctor said, "So, what's the problem with you?"
The old man said, "The problem is, I don't get up until nine o'clock every morning."
