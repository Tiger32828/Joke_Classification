A famous Chinese dog was smuggled into the United States, and the American dog asked how it was in China?
The Chinese dog replies: "Live well, eat well, sleep well!"
The American dog was puzzled: "Then why did you smuggle to the United States?"
The Chinese dog replied: "I just want to bark every once in a while."
