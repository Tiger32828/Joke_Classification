The director of a large company is usually very afraid of guilt, and is also curious if every man is like this, so he finds a day to gather all the married men in the company to stand in front of him.

Asked: "Now, people who think they are usually afraid of their wife stand on my left, and people who think they are not afraid of their wife stand on my right."
After speaking, there was a commotion, everyone stood to the left, only one stood to the right, and two others stood still.

He first asked the first person to stand still: "Why are you standing still?"
The man replied, "My wife told me that if there are factions in the company, they should remain neutral and neither side should participate, so I stand in the middle."

He asked the second man standing still, "Why are you standing still?"
The man replied, "My wife said, don't make decisions by yourself, you have to ask your wife before that. Can I call home first and ask?"

At this time, everyone looked at the man standing alone to the right with admiration, and asked him to give a speech.
I saw his finger pointing to the crowd on the left, and he said in a murmur, "My wife said, don't go to places with many people."
