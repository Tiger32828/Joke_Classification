Three years ago, I began to imitate Buffett: drinking Coke, eating beef burgers, sticking to a simple life, reading the Wall Street Journal Financial Times Caixin Business Value every day; choosing stocks to focus on fundamentals and long-term holding.
Now I'm all like Buffett except I lose 200% on my investments.
