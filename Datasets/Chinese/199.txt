There is an officer's school, and the instructor ordered two cadets to go to the school to do anti-drug propaganda.
As a result, at the end of the semester, the instructors found the best and worst students.

The instructor asked the worst student, "How did you preach?"
The student said: "He drew two circles on the blackboard, one large and one small, and then told the students: 'The larger circle is the head before drug use; the smaller one is the head after drug use.' "

The instructor asked the most effective student again, "How did you preach?"
The student said, "I also drew two circles, one big and one small. Then I told them, 'The smaller circle is the asshole before entering prison; the larger circle is the asshole after being released from prison.' "
