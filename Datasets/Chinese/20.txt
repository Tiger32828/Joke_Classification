Ball was in and out of jail regularly for his repeated violations of the law.
Once he was brought to court again, the judge asked, "How do you feel when you come to court often?"
"I don't have any ideas, I just think I'm unlucky."
"Don't you feel ashamed?"
After hearing this, Bauer said without shame, "What's the matter, I just come here often, and you are here every day."
