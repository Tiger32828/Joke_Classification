A few years ago, I was dragged by a friend to play an online game. Because I didn't like playing that much, I found a booster to help me level up to 40.
Then, when I reached level 42, my account was stolen gorgeously.
I lost my emotions, so I took the opportunity to stop playing.
Last week, my power leveling brother came to me and said that the database had been stolen, and many of their customer accounts had been stolen. After confirming that I was also stolen, they helped me contact customer service to get it back.

The climax is here! That account has become level 60, with the best equipment.
