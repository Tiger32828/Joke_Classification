There is a single girl whose apartment is being redecorated. So she asked her neighbor,
Whether it is possible to spend the night at his house, he agreed.
That night, when they had just been lying down for ten minutes, the girl cried, "Neighbor, neighbor, are you asleep?"
"Not yet!" the neighbor replied.
"I'm so cold that I can't sleep. Could you please close the window for me?" the girl said.
The neighbor got up and closed the window.
Ten minutes later, the girl called again, "Neighbor, neighbor, are you asleep?"
"not yet........."
"I'm so hot that I can't sleep. Could you please open the window for me?" the girl said.
Once again, the neighbor got up and opened the window.
Ten minutes later, the girl said again, "Neighbor, neighbor, are you asleep? I'm so cold, can you go to the closet and help me get the blanket?"
"I have a better way," said the neighbor. "Pretend we're married, okay?"
"I like this way very much!" the girl said, feeling sober in her heart, her little trick finally succeeded, and now she can cook cooked rice with the neighbor's raw rice.
"Okay!" said the neighbor, "you lazy bastard, get up and get it yourselfâ€”"
