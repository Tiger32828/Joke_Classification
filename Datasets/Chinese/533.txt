On this day, the teacher handed out the test paper: "Liao Shufen, 60 points! You, you can get 60 points because your name sounds like 60 points?!"
The teacher said displeasedly, "Wu Shufen, 50 points! You! It's not as good as Liao Shufen!"
The teacher still said angrily... Then,
In an even more angry tone, the teacher handed out the next test paper: "Ke Shufen, 10 points! Oh, you are the same! You give me 10 points if your name sounds like 10 points?!"

At this time...
"Ah! I'm done..." Ke Shufen's sister began to cry out in her heart...
The teacher sighed and reluctantly posted the third picture: "It's not that I'm saying that you two sisters are so outrageous..." "Ke Lingfen... 0 points!"
The teacher shook his head and said, "You two sisters should take a good look at your brother. He always gets full marks. You two shouldn't keep taking tests like that."
Sisters Ke Shufen and Ke Lingfen cursed inwardly:


"Well, it's my parents who took my brother's name... Kojiba!!!"
