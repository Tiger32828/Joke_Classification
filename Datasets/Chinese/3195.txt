My uncle is a used car dealer. One day, an old lady came to buy a car and saw several cars of different brands.
She didn't try driving, she just got the key, turned on the radio on the car, and pressed the button to select the station.
Seeing the bewildered look on my uncle's face, she explained, "I don't know much about cars, but I can tell from the radio whether they are good or bad.
If the music playing was rock music, you can imagine that the car must have been driving hard before. I only buy cars that listen to classical or light music - I've never bought a broken car in seventeen years. "
