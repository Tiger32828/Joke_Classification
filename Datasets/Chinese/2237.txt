The little girl asked her mother, "How did people come here?"
Mom replied, "God created Adam and Eve, and they had children, and after many generations, there are us!"
A few days later, the little girl asked her dad the same question.
Dad replied, "A long, long time ago, we changed little by little from monkeys."
Confused, she ran to her mother again, "Mom, you said that humans were created by God! But my father said we were transformed from monkeys! How could this be?"
Mom replied, "Baby, I'm talking about people from our parents' side, and dad is talking about people from their side."
