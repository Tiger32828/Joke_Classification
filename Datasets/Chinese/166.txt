A gentleman went to the bank to apply for a loan.

Mr.: Hello Miss, I want to apply for a loan.
Miss: Okay, sir, may I ask your surname?
Mr.: Yes, my surname is Gao.
Miss: Well, what about the name?
Mr.: Well... just call me Mr. Gao.
Miss: Excuse me, may I ask your name?
Mr.: It's okay.... just call me Mr. Gao.
Miss: But we have a lot of customers with the surname Gao, so please tell me your name.
The husband said with an embarrassed expression: My surname is Gao, and I have a single name.
