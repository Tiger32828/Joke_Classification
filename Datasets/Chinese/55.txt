Teacher: "Xiaoxin, please use "dilemma" to make a sentence"

Xiaoxin: "I was in a dilemma during the exam"

Teacher: "Is it because you can't answer the question, making you in a dilemma?"

Xiaoxin: "No, it's because the left and right classmates have different answers, which makes me in a dilemma."
