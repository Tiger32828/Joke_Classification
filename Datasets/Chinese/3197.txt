My husband and I were both under the age of twenty when we were in a relationship.
On the first New Year's Eve date, I went out in the new car he had just bought.
He was triumphant, and at midnight the horns were blaring and they were kissing each other, and I was expecting some tender words from him.
He looked me in the eyes and said, "Damn, my car is a year old."
