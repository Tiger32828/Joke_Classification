Husband and wife quarreled, husband slammed the door and left, wife asked him what time he came back from the window?
Husband said: come back again is the grandson!
The wife was very angry and locked the door...
Two hours later, my husband knocked on the door and shouted:

"Grandma, I'm back!"
Hahaha! Why care so much when a man can stretch or shrink...
