There are two kinds of meals, pork chop and beef, for passengers to choose and enjoy on the flight of the airline.
The flight attendant asked each passenger which one they would like to enjoy.
In order to save time, a flight attendant only asked, "Are you a pig or a cow?"
The traveler also cooperated, replying, "The four of us are pigs."
