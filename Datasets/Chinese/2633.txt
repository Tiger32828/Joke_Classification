A man is traveling to Canada.
When he walked out of the hotel, because he was afraid of losing his way back, he could not come back, so he copied down the street name written on the wall of this street.
Later, after playing around for a long time, he really got lost, so he asked the police with the street name he had copied down.
When the police took a look, it turned out that what he had copied was: "Stick No Bill--(No posters)"
