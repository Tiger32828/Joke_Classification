When it was quiet at night, two gangsters, A Ming and A Xian, jumped from the ceiling into a large supermarket chain to steal. Not long after, the two "harvest" a lot, but they were accidentally locked at the door.
Seeing this, A Ming said angrily, "It's over! We can't get out!"
Ah Xian listened to the old god and said, "Don't be afraid, big brother, we are here waiting for them to open the door to do business, can't we go out?"
