Once, a king asked his soldiers this question while reviewing his troops: "If I personally order you to shoot at me, will you obey me?"
All the soldiers replied, "Obey. Because it is the duty of the soldiers to obey, and since it is an order, it must be absolutely obeyed."
But only one soldier said, "I don't shoot."
The king was overjoyed and praised the soldier.
"Okay! My boy, at least I saw one soldier who put the king's life above the duty of a soldier."
He later asked the soldier why he didn't shoot him.
"Because I don't have a gun, I'm a messenger."
