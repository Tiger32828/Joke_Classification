In order to ask for a clear card, Xiao Zhang went to a temple to ask the gods for divination. As a result, the clear card was revealed, causing him to cost tens of millions!
Before Xiao Zhang ran away, the more he thought about it, the more angry he became, and when no one was around, he went to the temple to vent his anger. He dragged the statue out and threw it into the ditch; still very angry, he set fire to the temple again!
Unexpectedly, a few years later, when he returned to the local area, the small temple became larger and larger.
When I asked others about the results, I realized that there was a fire in this temple before, and the statue would run out by itself and hide in the ditch!
