Someone: "God! What does a hundred years mean to you?"

God: "One hundred years is like one minute."

Someone: "So, what about a million dollars?"

God: "It's about the same as a copper plate."

Someone: "Great! God, how about lending me a copper plate?"

God: "I am very willing; however, just wait a minute."
