One day Ji Xiaolan entered the palace to face the Holy Spirit, but was stopped by a eunuch.
The eunuch knew that Ji Xiaolan was rich and witty, so he begged him to tell a story, otherwise he would not let him pass.
Ji Xiaolan had no choice but to say, "Once upon a time there was a eunuch..." After saying this, he paused, but did not continue.
The eunuch waited for a while and couldn't help but ask, "What about down there?" Ji Xiaolan smiled and said, "Below? No more!"
The eunuch blushed and had to let Ji Xiaolan go over embarrassingly.
