In a class where English test papers were distributed, a student was very unconvinced and went to the examiner to ask for scores:
"Teacher, the English word for coffee is correct! Why did you think I was wrong?"
Teacher: "It's c-o-f-f-e-e, not c-o-b-b-e-e!"
Student: "That's right! cobbee, add force (Taiwanese)"
