A professor's colleague was strictly controlled by his wife, and he was depressed all day.
I gave him an idea: "I'll take you to the boxing gym! You have to vent."
The colleague asked, "How to vent?"
I said, "Take the sandbag as your wife."
At the gym in the evening, the teacher of the physical fitness group asked, "Is the professor you brought sick?"
I asked, "What's the matter with him?"
The teacher of the physical fitness group said, "Your friend has been kneeling on the sandbag all afternoon!"
