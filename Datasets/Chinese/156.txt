Near the air force base, many pilots live in official residences with their families, and give handsome flight jackets to their wives.
One day, a pilot's wife wearing a handsome flight jacket went to the nearby market to buy food, and happened to meet the military police.
The military policeman said to the pilot's wife, "Ma'am, the flight jacket you are wearing now is a military item and cannot be used privately according to regulations."
The pilot's wife replied disdainfully, "My husband is also a military product, and I don't use it for personal use every day."
