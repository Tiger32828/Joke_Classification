There was a foreigner who was the president of a company. One day he recruited his employees and said:
"Hey~ everyone, in recent years... the company's economy has been bad, and there has been no turnaround..."
"I want to ask everyone... If you take a 30% pay cut, will you do it?"
One of the employees knocked on the table on the spot and said, "Go!"
