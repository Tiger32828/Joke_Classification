Mr. Zhang called customer service and said his computer wouldn't turn on,
The waiter asked some questions, when asked if the computer was plugged in,
Mr. Zhang said, "Wait a minute, I'll get a flashlight to see clearly."
Waiter: "What are you doing with the flashlight?"
Mr. Zhang: "It's too dark here, and there is a problem with the power supply."
The waiter told him that the computer wouldn't work without power.
Mr. Zhang said angrily, "Didn't the salesperson say that the computer comes with a backup?"
