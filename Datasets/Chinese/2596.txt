An old lady bought two sexy pajamas, one red and one black, hoping to surprise her husband.
At night, she tried it on for her husband to see how he reacted.
For the first time, she wore red first, and dangled it in front of her husband. As a result, her husband was lying on the bed reading the newspaper and turned a blind eye.
The second time, she put on black, but her husband still read his newspaper, indifferent.
In the end, she got angry and simply stripped naked and dangled in front of her husband, but her husband still didn't respond.
So she had to put on ordinary pajamas, but she was still very unwilling, so she asked her husband: "Husband, I put on a few pajamas for you to see, why are you ignoring me?"
The husband replied, "I don't like to say it...that red one is suitable for young girls to wear. You really don't look good in it."
The old woman asked again, "Then...what about the black one?"
Her husband replied: "That's to be sexy, and a person with a good figure will look good in it."
Then, the old woman looked at her husband intently and asked, "What about the third item?"
Unexpectedly, her husband replied: "I don't want to mention the last one, it's crumpled, there are two buttons on the front dangling there, and the seams are not sewn properly, you can see that it is a bargain bought at the night market! "
