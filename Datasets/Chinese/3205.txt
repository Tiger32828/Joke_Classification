A church heating system was faulty, and after many laymen tried various methods to repair it to no avail, the parish priest called a plumber.
The plumber worked for hours with no progress, scratching his head and kneeling in front of the radiator to inspect.
Just then the pastor walked in and said with a smile, "No need, all of us in the congregation have tried this method!"
