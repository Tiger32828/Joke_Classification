Zhuzhu, who was getting married the next day, worriedly said to her sister-in-law, "What should I do? He always thought I was a virgin. On the night of the bridal chamber tomorrow, he will definitely find out that I am not a virgin at all... ."
The sister-in-law said, "It doesn't matter, I have experience with this."
The sister-in-law took out a magic weapon and said: "Here is a small wallet with a metal buckle. When you go to bed tomorrow night, you will put it under your buttocks and hold it with one hand. When he puts his treasure in you, you will put it The metal button is on. He'll ask you what that sound is? You tell him it's the sound of a hymen bursting."
On the night of the bridal chamber, Zhuzhu followed the method that her sister-in-law said, and the groom really shouted, "What's that sound?"
Zhuzhu said shyly, "That's the sound of my hymen breaking."
The groom yelled, "What? Open up your damn hymen, it's got my baby balls caught.
