The phone rang, and I asked Mr. Lin to speak.
Ma asked, "Big or small?"
It was me who was looking for it. After I answered the phone, I said to my mother, "Don't call me little in the future, okay?"
Soon, someone called Mr. Lin again, and his mother asked him, "Older or younger?"
"Old?" Dad complained. "Do you have to say I'm old?"
After speaking, the phone rang again: "Is Mr. Lin at home?"
Mom thought about it and said, "Can you tell what it looks like?"
