A group of people went on a trip, two people were arranged to eat at a table, and one of them picked up the larger and larger portion to eat.
The other person was unhappy in his heart and could not say it clearly, so he said in a roundabout way: "If I were you, I would eat a small portion."
The man then replied, "That's right, didn't I leave the little one for you?"
