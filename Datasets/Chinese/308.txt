I just called and asked my favorite beautiful colleague to watch a movie this weekend,
What I didn't expect was a female colleague! I didn't want to watch a movie, but wanted to visit my family directly!
Happiness comes so suddenly!
I hung up the phone and couldn't calm down for a long time...

From time to time, the words that the beautiful colleague just said echoed in my ears:
"Look at your mother!"
