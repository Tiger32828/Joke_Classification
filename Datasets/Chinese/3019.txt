"Uncle John came to stay for a few days, and when he left, he took out 100 yuan and said to his nephew Tom:
"Keep this money for your own use! Remember, you have to keep the money. If you lose it, you will give it away for nothing."
Tom said excitedly, "Yes, a fool would give away money for nothing!"
Uncle John thought about it and said, "You're right, I think it's better if you don't want the money."
