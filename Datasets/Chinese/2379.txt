Lao Wang was invited to be a guest at Lao Li's house... In Lao Li's house,

I saw that Old Li called his wife "Dear".

Seeing this, Lao Wang was very moved and said to Lao Li:

"It's really not easy for you! It's been almost 10 years of marriage,

You still call your wife so sweet..."

"Actually," Old Li said in a low voice:

"I forgot her name for a long time..."

Be careful...
