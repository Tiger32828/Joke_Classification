William took his friend John to dinner, but the only food on the table was tofu...
William said to John, "I like tofu the most. Tofu is my life. I think tofu is the best delicacy in the world."
A few days later, William came to John's house as a guest, and John added tofu to the fish and meat.
However, William didn't eat tofu at all, only fish and meat.
John asked curiously, "Didn't you say tofu is your life? Why don't you eat tofu today?"
William said, "I don't even want my life when I see fish and meat."
