One day in a Pub...
A said, "My wife and I came here four times last night, and in the morning my wife said to me, 'Husband, I adore you so much!'"
B said, "I came with my wife six times yesterday, and in the morning my wife said to me, 'I will never fall in love with anyone else!'"
Everyone asked C, "How many times did you and your wife come here last night?"
C said, "Once."
Everyone asked disdainfully, "What did your wife tell you that morning?"
C said: "Husband don't stop!"
