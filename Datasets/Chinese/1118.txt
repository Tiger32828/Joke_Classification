Fangfang and Xiaoling have seldom come to sister gatherings since they got married and had children. On this day, the two spent half a day of leisure, and finally had time to have a good cup of afternoon tea.
Fangfang: "Oh, I don't mean to say that, my son really likes sucking his fingers, and he can't change it. In the end, I had to be ruthless and put chili oil on his fingers."
Xiao Ling was taken aback and hurriedly asked, "That must be useful, right? I bet he won't dare to suck his fingers again!"
Fangfang: "Oh, don't mention it! My son says he wants to eat Sichuan, Hunan, and Thai food every day. Anyway, he loves spicy food!"
