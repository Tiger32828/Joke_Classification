Once in the middle of class, the math teacher said to us:
"Everyone is very tired from class, so let me tell you a story about "Journey to the West" to relax.
It is said that Tang Seng and his apprentice traveled westward and were targeted by the white bone spirit. On the way, Tang Seng was hungry and asked Sun Wukong to go out to find something to eat.
In order not to be taken away by his master, Wukong drew a circle on the ground with a radius of 2 meters. What is the area of ​​this circle? "
This is the unity of the students in the class: "Teacher, you are enough!"
