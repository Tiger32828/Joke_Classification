The impatient Ayou fell ill this day and was sent to the emergency room. The nurse had just helped him to hang up the drip not long ago. In order to be in a hurry, he actually started to speed up the speed of the drip.
Seeing this, the passing nurses quickly slowed down the drip. Unexpectedly, as soon as the nurse walked away, Ayou immediately adjusted the drip faster, and was soon discovered by the nurse again.
Nurse: "Why do you speed up the drip?"
Ayou: "I'm in a hurry!"
The nurse scolded angrily: "In a hurry? Then you can drink faster!"
Ayu: "..."
