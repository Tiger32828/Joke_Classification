There was a peasant woman who delivered eggs to the merchants in the city every week.
One day she asked the businessman, "How much did you pay for a dozen eggs?"
"Sixpence."
"Sixpence a dozen! The price is too low," said the peasant woman to the merchant.
"It's a little lower. But we held a meeting in our store yesterday and unanimously decided not to offer a higher price than this."
The peasant woman had no choice but to sell the eggs to the merchant at this price.
A week later, the peasant woman still delivered eggs to the merchant.
The merchant looked at her eggs and said, "Your eggs are too small this time."
The peasant woman said, "It's a little smaller. My chickens had a meeting yesterday, and they thought that sixpence a dozen eggs,
You can only lay such a big egg, there is no need to go to great lengths to lay eggs larger than this. "
