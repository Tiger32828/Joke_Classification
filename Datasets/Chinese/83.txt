There is a person who is in his thirties and still has no success in his career, he can't find a job, he can't do his career, and he has been unable to make money.

So, go to a fortune teller to see your fortune.

"You, you will remain poor until the age of forty."

When the man heard this, his eyes lit up, thinking that there was a turning point, and immediately asked, "Then what?"

"And then..." The fortune teller looked at his horoscope and said, "Then you'll get used to it."
