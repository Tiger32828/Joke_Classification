One day Ah Zheng's father took him to a birthday banquet for his relatives, and the last dish was peach.
This dead Ah Zheng asked his father very ignorantly: "Dad! Dad! This looks like a butt."
All the relatives and friends present felt that the child was very ignorant of talking indiscriminately, and all the relatives and friends were waiting to see how his father would teach him a lesson.
I saw his father picked up a longevity peach and opened it: "Yeah, look there's poop in it!"
