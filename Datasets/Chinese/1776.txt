The father and son went to pay homage to the son and suddenly asked, "Dad, what is a large scale."
Father thought for a while, then said, "Have you seen the Guanyin statue? It's tightly packed. This is called solemnity."
He continued: "Seeing Maitreya Buddha or not, his stomach is exposed. This is called a large scale!"
