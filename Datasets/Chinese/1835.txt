The wife can never be wrong.
If I find my wife is wrong, I must be wrong.
If I read it right, it must be my fault that made my wife make a mistake.
If it's her own fault, as long as she doesn't admit it, she's not wrong.
If my wife does not admit her fault and I insist that she is wrong, it is my fault.
In short, the wife is absolutely not wrong, this sentence is absolutely not wrong.
