An engineer could not find a job, so he opened a private clinic,
I put a sign outside,
It reads "If the disease is cured, pay $300; ​​if it is not cured, refund $1000."
A doctor saw this sign and thought it was a good opportunity to make money, so he decided to visit an engineer's clinic.

Doctor: "I've lost my sense of taste. I can't taste it."
Engineer: "Nurse, take the medicine from box 22 and put three drops in the patient's mouth."
Patient (doctor): "Damn, this is gasoline!"
Engineer: "Congratulations, your sense of taste is restored, pay me $300."
The doctor had to pay the money and left in disgust.

Returned to the clinic a few days later, intending to recover the lost money.
Doctor: "I lost my memory, I can't remember anything."
Engineer: "Nurse, bring the medicine from box 22 to the sick, and put three drops in the person's mouth."
Doctor: "Damn, isn't this the medicine for the taste last time!?"
Engineer: "Congratulations, your memory is restored, please pay $300."
The doctor had to pay again, left angrily, and returned to the clinic a few days later.

Doctor: "My vision is poor."
Engineer: "Sorry! I don't have any medicine for this disease, this is your $1000 refund..."
Doctor: "But this is $500!"
Engineer: "Congratulations, your eyesight is restored, please pay me $300."
