One day Xiaobao was in a history class when he heard the teacher talk about Qin Shihuang's tyranny - burning books and beating Confucians,
He put on a pooping face, happened to be seen by the teacher, and asked, "Little treasure, who offended you?"
Xiaobao said, "Qin Shihuang!"
The teacher asked, "Why?"
Xiaobao said, "Because he didn't finish the book!"
