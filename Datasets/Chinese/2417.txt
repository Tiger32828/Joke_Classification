A 50kg man married a 100kg woman.
On the second day of the wedding, the woman complained to the man, "Why are you like a waste battery, unable to light the light bulb?"
The man defended aggrievedly: "The battery didn't fail. It's just that the flashlight has a large number, and the battery number is small, so the positive and negative poles can't be connected to each other."
