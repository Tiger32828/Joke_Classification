One day, Lawson was walking past the Sydney Opera House and saw a woman in tattered clothes selling newspapers.
Her voice was hoarse, and she was holding a sleeping baby in her arms. The poet wanted to help, and hurriedly took out the money to buy her newspaper.
At this moment, another child came running, holding a newspaper and shouting in a hoarse voice, "Sell the newspaper! Sell the newspaper!"
Lawson looked at the poor child, and then at the poor woman, and hesitated.
Who should buy it? The kid saw it and said politely to Lawson, "Sir, it doesn't matter! It's the same thing. She's my mother."
