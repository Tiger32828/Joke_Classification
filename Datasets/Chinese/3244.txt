A fortune teller said that he could tell good and bad without the need for others to speak.
One day, an old woman came to tell her fortune. The fortune teller saw her frowning deeply and said, "I think you have something to hide."
After hearing this, the old woman shook her head, and the fortune-teller asked again, "Is that because the children are unfilial?"
The old woman still shook her head: "Is that the husband is having an affair?" The old woman just shook her head.
The fortune teller began to worry, but no matter how he guessed, the old woman shook her head in the same way.
He finally said, "Then why are you here to tell your fortune?"
The old woman replied, "Because I have a shaking head disease, please do the math for me!"
