One day, the veterinarian ordered the assistant to give the horse medicine. After a while the assistant came back and said, "If the horse doesn't open its mouth, it won't go in."
"Stupid!" the veterinarian scolded, "Put a tube into the horse's mouth, leave half of it out, put the pills in the tube, blow hard, won't the pills go into the horse's stomach?"
After a while, the assistant came back. The veterinarian asked, "How is it? Did the horse swallow all the pills?"
The assistant said with a sad face: "No, I swallowed the pills, I didn't think that the horse was blowing more air than me..."
