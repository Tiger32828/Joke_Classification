A company executive was on tour of his department when he saw an exhausted employee sitting behind a desk,
So he gave him a piece of advice: "For two weeks in a row, I went home at noon every day to have my wife serve. It's really great and helps relieve fatigue. You should try it!"
Two weeks later, he visited the department again and saw the happy face of the employee last time. Faxed documents are everywhere, and the computers are constantly running.
"Looks like you did take my advice?"
"Yeah!" replied the employee, "that's really cool, and I didn't expect your place to be so luxurious!"
