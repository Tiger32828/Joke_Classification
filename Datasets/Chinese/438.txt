The sommelier of a century-old winery dies, and the winery manager begins to look for new sommeliers, issue announcements, and recruit talents.
A drunken man in ragged clothes and a scruffy face came to the winery to apply.
The manager was very upset when he saw the drunk, thinking how to get rid of him...
He asked someone to bring a glass of wine, and the drunkard took it for a little taste and then said: "Muscat wine, three-year alcohol, grapes grown on the north slope, brewed in large wooden barrels. Although it is low-end, the quality is acceptable."
"Exactly." The manager nodded and called for another glass of wine.
After tasting it, the drunk said, "Red wine, eight years old, grown in the southwest slope, fresh oak barrels, brewed at a constant temperature of 8 degrees Celsius. To get the best taste, it needs to be stored for three years."
The winery manager was amazed! "Exactly." Then another glass.

This time, the drunkard thoughtfully lowered his head and said, "No vintage Pinot Champagne, exclusive and high-end." The drunkard replied calmly.
At this moment, the manager was shocked. He winked at the secretary beside him. The secretary left the room and came back with a glass of urine in his hand and handed it to the drunk. He still took a sip.
I just heard the drunk man say coldly, "Blonde, 26 years old, three months pregnant, and... If you don't give me your job, I'll tell you who the father is."
