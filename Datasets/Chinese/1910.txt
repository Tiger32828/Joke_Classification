As soon as the girl got on the train, she saw a man sitting in her seat.
She checked her ticket and said politely, "Sir, are you sitting in the wrong seat?"
The man took out his ticket and shouted, "Look clearly, this is my seat, are you blind?"
The girl looked at his ticket carefully, stopped making a sound, and stood silently beside him.
After a while, the train started slowly and left the platform. The girl lowered her head and said to the man, "Sir, you are not in the wrong place, you are in the wrong train!"
There is a kind of forbearance, it's called it's too late to make you regret it, if it can solve the problem, the chicken would have ruled the world long ago!
