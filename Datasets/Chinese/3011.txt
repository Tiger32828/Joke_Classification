A gangster hijacked the plane with a bag of explosives. The plane ran out of fuel in flight and had to make an emergency landing.
The captain said to the hijackers: "Hurry up and throw the explosives out of the plane. It will explode due to violent vibration during the forced landing."
The hijacker said angrily, "Stop talking! I've never heard of a can of sardines that explode."
