When I met my wife, I called her "Li Sufang", and the relationship went a step further and called her "Sufen".
Called "Fen" after kissing, called "Fenfang" when going to bed, and called "heart, baby" during the honeymoon,
When the divorce was called "Li Sufen", when the court made a judgment, it was called "Ms. Li Sufen".
After leaving the marriage, he called: "What, what.... here?"
