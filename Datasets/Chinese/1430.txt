A couple of the same age celebrated their 60th birthday together. When it was lively, suddenly, an angel appeared.
The angel said: "I wish you 60 years old, you make a wish, and I will fulfill it." The 60-year-old wife said: "I really want to travel around the world."
The angel said, "Finish you." Dang! The wife has a plane ticket to travel around the world.
The angel asked her 60-year-old husband, "What about you? What wish?" The husband asked, "Will it really come true?"
The angel said: "I never regret it." The husband made a wish with great joy: "I hope I can now hold a woman who is 30 years younger than me."
The angel said, "Finish you." Dang! Husband turned 90.
