My husband and I were very attentive to our six-year-old daughter Kiki that a younger brother or sister would be coming.
So when we brought our newborn son, Ji Wei, home from the hospital, Kiki was still very happy.
Everything went well until the parents-in-law came to see the new grandson, and the problem occurred. They only greeted Qiqi briefly,
He walked quickly to see his grandson, and went to the cradle to play with him.
Later, I found Kiki angry alone in the room.
When I went to ask her what was going on...
She said disgustingly: "My brother wants to share you and dad with me. I don't care, but even my mother-in-law refuses to bring it by himself. He wants to share it with me. It's really inappropriate."
