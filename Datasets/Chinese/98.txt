There was a young man who had just been admitted to the Beiyi girl. On the day of registration, she went to Taipei for the first time. Although her family told her the location of the Beiyi girl, she still got lost.
So she planned to ask passers-by. But she wanted to say that it was too embarrassing to ask where the school was in the uniform of a girl from the north.
So I came up with a method: "Sir, how do I get to the Presidential Palace?" (I'm smart)
Passerby: "Huh? Isn't the Presidential Palace just in front of your school?"
