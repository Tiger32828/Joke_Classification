There was a fat man who got on the plane and found that the same seat was a parrot.
But now it's the Internet era, and there are all kinds of strange things, so I don't think it's strange.
He was a little thirsty, so he asked the flight attendant for a glass of water, but the lady was always busy and didn't have time to deliver water for a long time.

At this time, the parrot next to him spoke: I X your uncle's! Why hasn't the XO I requested been delivered yet!
The stewardess immediately brought XO over, and kept making up for it.

The fat man looked, oh, so they eat this set.

So he also shouted loudly: You X your grandma's! Why hasn't the water I requested been delivered yet!
The flight attendant also arrived immediately, but this time followed by two burly men. The two of them fought and threw the fat man out.

Fatty couldn't understand in mid-air, how could he be inferior to a parrot?

As soon as the hatch opened, the parrot was thrown out.
The parrot flew to the fat man and said, "Silly B, how dare you be so arrogant if you don't have wings?
