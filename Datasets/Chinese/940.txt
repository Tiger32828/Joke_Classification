Xiao Ming's mother asked Xiao Ming to get up, and Xiao Ming lay on the bed and said, "I don't want to go to school."
Mom said, "Why?"
Xiao Ming said, "Because my classmates don't like me and my teacher hates me too, so I don't want to go!"
"How can you do this, today is the opening ceremony!" Mom said.
"And you're the principal, how can you not go!"
