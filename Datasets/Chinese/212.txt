A bald man walks into a beauty salon.
Hairstylist: "What do you want?"
Bald man: "I've had hair transplants, but I can't stand the pain. If you can make my hair look like yours without any pain, I'll give you 30,000 yuan."
The hair stylist thought for a while and said, "No problem!"

Immediately took the money, and immediately began to shave his hair.
