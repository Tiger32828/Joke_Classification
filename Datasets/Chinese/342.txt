In the evening, I was walking with my grandfather in the park, and a beautiful woman walked by not far away. I couldn't help but take a second glance.

Grandpa asked me, "Do you like it?" I nodded embarrassedly.
Grandpa asked again, "Want her phone number?"
Instantly I blushed. Grandpa said, "Look at me!", then turned and walked towards the beauty.

A few minutes later my phone rang, and a sweet voice came from it: "Hello, are you XXX? Your grandfather is lost, come and pick him up, we are at XX in the park."
I quietly saved this mobile phone number, and my heart was full of admiration for my grandfather.
