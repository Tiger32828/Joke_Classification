A woman had an affair and kept her nine-year-old son in the closet every time her lover came.

One day, she was having a tryst with her lover, and suddenly the neighbor knocked on the door to borrow something, so she put her lover in the closet.
"It's so dark in here," said the little boy in the closet.
"Yes!" the man replied.
"Want to buy a baseball?" the little boy asked.
"No, thanks," the man replied.
"I think you need to buy a baseball," the little blackmailer continued. "Hey, it's no fun here."
The man weighed his current situation and replied, "Okay! How much?"
"Twenty-five dollars?"
"Twenty-five dollars?"
"Twenty-five dollars, a lot of money!"
The man had no choice but to give in.

Two days later, the man came to his lover's house again, and soon heard the sound of a neighbor knocking on the door.
Women likewise keep their lovers in their sons' closets.
"It's so dark in here!" the little boy started again.
"Yes!" the man replied.
"Would you like to buy a baseball glove?" the little boy asked.
Knowing that he had the upper hand, the man replied, "Okay! How much?"
"Fifty dollars."
The business went through smoothly.

At the end of the week, the little boy's father said, "Hey, son, go get the baseballs and gloves, let's go play!"
"No, I sold all those things," the little boy replied.
"How much did you sell for?" Dad thought he was just exchanging biscuits or candy or something.
"Seventy-five dollars," replied the little boy.
"Seventy-five dollars? It's a robbery! Come, go to the church with me to confess your sins!" The father taught the little boy while he walked away.

When they got to the church, the little boy walked to the confession room, closed the curtain, sat down and said, "It's really dark in here!"
The priest said grimly: "Don't think about doing that again here!"
