One day, three sisters died and were taken to heaven by angels.
The angel said to them, "There is a rule in heaven that you must never pick ducks."
As they talked, the sisters saw that all the ducks were on the ground, so they walked carefully every day.
One day, the eldest sister stepped on the duck, and with a "quack", the angel brought a very ugly man and leaned against her with a bracelet. The second and third sisters were very scared, so they walked more carefully every day. .
Unexpectedly, the second sister stepped on the duck, and with a "quack", the angel brought a very, very ugly man and leaned against her with a chain, and the third sister was even more afraid from then on.
Three years later, the third sister never stepped on the duck. One day, the angel suddenly brought a handsome and strong man and leaned against her with a bracelet.
The third sister said shyly, "Why did you come here?"
The man replied, "I don't know, but I stepped on a duck."
