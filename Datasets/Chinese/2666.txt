Zheng Jun ate lunch at a poor friend's place. He had eaten two bowls but still didn't feel full. When he visited Fanluo, there was no more rice.
So he also picked up his chopsticks and tapped the bowl and asked, "Dude, this bowl of yours is really good, when did you buy it?"
The poor master quickly took out an empty rice pot from the next door and replied, "Brother! I bought it with this pot!"
