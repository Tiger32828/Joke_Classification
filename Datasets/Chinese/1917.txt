The new bishop heard that when he arrived in New York, he was likely to be dragged into a preset trap by the press, so he was extra careful.
As soon as they came out of the airport, a reporter asked, "Do you want to go to a nightclub?"
Wanting to avoid the question, the bishop smiled and asked, "Is there a nightclub in New York?"
The next morning the headlines of the visit in the newspapers read:
"Bishop's first question after getting off the plane: Are there nightclubs in New York?"
