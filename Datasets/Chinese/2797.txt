A gentleman approached the priest: "Listen to me, priest, I want to repent to you because..."
"Speak! My child, I listen to your confession with the kindness of a priest."
"Well then, Father, during the war I...I covered a man who was being hunted by the Nazis."
"It's a good thing to save a life, my poor boy, it's not a sin."
"I mean...I mean...I hid him in my cellar and made him pay me 1,500 francs a day in rent..."
"You for this?"
"Yes. And...you understand?..."
"I understand very well. I understand that you are trying to get rid of your vanity. You know that you are a good child of the Lord, Amen!"
"No, Father, I mean I want to repent..."
"Son, no, you really did a merciful thing for the Lord."
"No, Father, because I haven't told him until now that the war is over."
