One day, a certain A and a certain B got together to discuss in order to be stingy.
A: "I cut the salted egg into six pieces, and one piece can be eaten for two days with one meal."
B: "What's that? I'll poke a hole in the salted egg and dip my chopsticks into it when I want to eat, and then I can eat a meal."
A naturally conceded defeat.
A few days later, A and B heard that there was another expert, C, who was even more stingy, so they made an appointment to ask for advice.
It's coming soon! Suddenly I heard shouting from inside: "Unfilial son, look at me one more time! Forget about being salted to death!"
When I got closer, I saw that C's house used a rope to hang a pickle from the ceiling, and it was a meal. The child was scolded after looking at it too much.
