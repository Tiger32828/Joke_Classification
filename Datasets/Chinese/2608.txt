At the dinner party, someone kept playing with the axe in front of the learned Bernard Shaw, saying how rich his knowledge was.
Bernard Shaw couldn't take it anymore, so he told him, "It sounds like this, if the two of us are put together, there's probably nothing in the world that we don't understand."
The man was a little surprised and said, "No way, really?"
Bernard Shaw replied, "You know everything, you just don't know that you hate it, but I just happen to know this!"
