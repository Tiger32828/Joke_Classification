It is said that Confucius was ugly.
One day the teacher was teaching the Analects and found that Xiao Ming was dozing off.
Teacher: "Xiao Ming, don't go to bed all day long. You must learn from Confucius and study hard, and you will be able to stand out in the future."
Xiao Ming: "If I look like Confucius, what can I do if I don't study hard?"
