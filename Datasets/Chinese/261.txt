One day, during a social science teaching observation, the principal and the inspectors watched the class from the back of the classroom.​​
The teacher asked the students, "Who knows what fruits Taiwan will produce in summer?"
Classmate A: "Pineapple"
Student B: "Banana"
After talking for a long time, the students have finished talking about the fruits that should be said! But only the watermelon is missing!​​
​​
The teacher was very anxious and thought to himself: What the hell is going on here?​​
At this time, a classmate suddenly raised his hand, and the teacher breathed a sigh of relief!​​
The classmate said, "Teacher! The classmate who wanted to say watermelon didn't come~"
