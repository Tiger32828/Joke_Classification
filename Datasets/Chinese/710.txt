My son is ill, we invited a doctor to come to diagnose.
After some examinations, the doctor turned to us and said, "I think you should invite a priest over here."
The wife screamed, "Oh my God! Is he dead?"
The doctor replied: "No, he is just very constipated. I think the priest should be able to solve this problem."
