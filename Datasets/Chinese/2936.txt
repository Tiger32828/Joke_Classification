During the economic downturn, a wife complained to her husband: "You lose money buying stocks and investing in real estate. Anyway, nothing is right."
"Why not? I married you, you just made money from investing!" The husband retorted confidently.
The wife was very happy to hear this, and gave her husband a sweet look.
Unexpectedly, the husband added another sentence: "When you got married, you were less than 50 kilograms!"
When the wife heard this, she didn't know whether to laugh or cry, and then she threw a pink fist at her husband, but it only slammed heavily and fell gently.
