just received
me: hello
The other party: Hello sir, we are a certain bank, your credit card XXXXXX
I thought to myself: Dad Lin didn't have a credit card
At this time, I happened to be next to the computer, so I took the phone to the speaker and played the song of the Great Compassion Mantra
After about 20 seconds...
The other party: Hello~ Sir, did you hear that? ? (still pretending, right)
So I turned off the Great Compassion Mantra, put down the porn, oh oh oh...
After a few seconds, the other party hangs up...
