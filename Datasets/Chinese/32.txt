"Report to the boss, there will be a batch of orders in Europe next month,
I think companies need to bring people to meetings with them. "
The boss signed a short note behind the official document: "Go a head".

Plan the itinerary and pack your luggage.

Manager: "Didn't the boss tell me Go a head?"
Secretary: "I have been in the company for so long,
Don't you know your boss's English level yet?
The boss means: go head to head! "
