A drunk man came home, climbed onto the bed and woke up his wife and said, "Honey, our house is haunted!"
His wife sat up and said, "What did you say?"
The drunk said, "I went to the toilet when I came back, and as soon as I opened the door, the light came on!"
His wife said, "Really?"
He nodded vigorously and said, "Exactly!"
His wife thought about it and said, "Do you still feel a gust of wind blowing out?"
He hurriedly said, "Yes! How did you know?"
His wife then slapped him hard and said, "Damn it! This is the third time you've urinated in the refrigerator while drunk!"
