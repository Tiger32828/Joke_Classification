I was playing golf with a friend one morning and saw a bus stop by the side of the road at the end of the grass.
After getting out of the car, the driver ran over out of breath and asked if we had a phone in the clubhouse. I asked him if the car broke down.
"No," he said uneasily, "it was a mysterious journeyâ€”but I got lost."
