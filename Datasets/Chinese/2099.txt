In less than 30 seconds, he came out like a defeated cock, and the words were still in his mouth: too wide.....too wide........

Just when everyone was in despair, a thin and small Chinese also pushed the door and went in after asking the truth.
All the people waited with schadenfreude for the Chinese to be kicked out by the rich woman, but they did not expect a miracle to happen!
