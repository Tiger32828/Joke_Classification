Xiao Ming went to the bird market and found a parrot priced at 3 yuan.
So he asked the seller, "Why is your parrot so cheap?"

Vendor: "I'm a stupid parrot! I've been teaching it for a long time. Until now, all I can say is: 'Who is it?'"
Xiao Ming thought it was cheap anyway, so he bought it.

When he got home at night, he thought, "I don't believe in you!"
So Xiao Ming taught it to say goodbye overnight.
But in the morning, the parrot still only said, "Who is it?"
When Xiao Ming got angry, he locked the door and went to work.

After a while, a little John came to check the cost of the water meter.
"Knock knock knock... (knock on the door)"
Parrot: "Who is it?"
Xiaohan: "Checking the water meter..."
Parrot: "Who is it?"
Xiaohan: "Checking the water meter..."
Parrot: "Who is it?"
Xiaohan: "Checking the water meter..."

At night, Xiao Ming came back.
I saw a man lying on the ground in front of the house, foaming at the mouth.
Xiaohan: "Yo! Who is this?"
I heard inside the house: "Check the water meter."
