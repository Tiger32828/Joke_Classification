The teacher asked the students: Who has never died in life since ancient times?
Student A: Since ancient times in life, who has no feces, who does not use paper for defecation.
The teacher was very angry and told the students to stand up.

The next day, the teacher asked the student the same question again, and the student became smarter.
He replied:
Since ancient times in life, who has no shit, who does not use paper for defecation.
If you don't use toilet paper, unless you use your fingers.

The teacher couldn't help laughing, and told the students to stand up! At this time, the teacher saw snow falling outside the window, and said regretfully:
It snowed and did not rain the previous day, but the snow turned into rain on the ground.
It's so troublesome when it becomes rain, why didn't it rain in the first place.

The student replied to the teacher:
Teachers do not eat shit, and the food turns into shit in the stomach.
It's so troublesome when it becomes shit, why didn't you eat shit in the first place.

The teacher fainted on the spot! Ha ha....
