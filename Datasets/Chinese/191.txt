A flight attendant of an airline, one day doing service on the cabin,
A passenger grandpa ordered milk to the flight attendant,
He said, "Miss! Get some milk and drink it!"
The stewardess was taken aback, but then came over and wrote down his request, "Sir, wait a moment."
The grandpa said again: "I want low breasts (fat)!"
Although he knew he wanted low-fat fresh milk, he couldn't help but laugh.
The flight attendant quickly walked back to the service staff's room and told the other flight attendants and flight attendants...
When everyone was laughing together, a young man suddenly raised his face and glanced at all the people with serious eyes, and everyone suddenly became quiet.
Finally, he set his eyes on a flight attendant: "You! You are the shortest, go and feed him!"
