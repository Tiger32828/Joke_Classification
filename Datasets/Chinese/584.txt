One day, Yueling's father asked Yueling: What is your favorite class at school?
For Yueling, who is in the third grade of elementary school, um... It should be a computer!
Because my dad is a computer engineer, I'm glad my daughter thinks about it again!
After a while ~ Yueling said again: Because computer teachers often ask for leave!
Ha ha!
