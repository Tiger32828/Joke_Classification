One day, the history teacher was in class and happened to mention Napoleon. Seeing the students under the stage dozing every day,
The teacher couldn't help but said with emotion, "Students, Napoleon only slept three hours a day. What inspiration do you get from this?"
Xiaoqiang replied, "If you don't get enough sleep, you won't grow taller."
