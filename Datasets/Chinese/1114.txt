At a company's spring wine dinner, it was rare for everyone to throw away their usual burdens and dance together, especially the seemingly serious senior executives also appeared one after another.
Ashu was chatting with his new dance partner Juanjuan, Ashu said, "Did you see that bad old man on the dance floor? He is the head of my department. I was scolded by him every day. It looks like he's just a bad old man!"
Juanjuan smiled and said, "Do you know who I am? I'm the daughter of that bad old man!"
Ashu listened and asked, "Do you know who I am?"
Juanjuan: "I don't know!"
Ashu: "Then thank God!" He disappeared immediately after speaking.
Juanjuan: "..."
