Daughter: I heard that "the first time" is very painful. What kind of pain method is it?
Mom: Imagine putting a carrot in your nostril...
Daughter: What about having a baby? Heard more pain?
Mom: Imagine putting a watermelon in your nostril and pulling it out...
daughter:..........

The son asked his father: Why is it so comfortable to have sex?
Dad said: It's like picking your nose, of course it's comfortable.
The son asked again: Then why are women more comfortable when they are having sex?
Dad said: Because when you pick your nostrils, it is your nostrils, not your fingers!
The son asked again: Then why do women feel sad when they are raped?
Dad said: If one day you are walking on the road and someone comes to pick your nostrils, will you feel comfortable?
The son asked again: Then why can't we have sex when menstruation comes?
Pa said: If you have a nosebleed, will you continue to pick your nose?
The son continued to ask: Why do many men not like to wear condoms?
Dad said: Do you wear gloves to pick your nose?
