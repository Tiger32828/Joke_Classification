A young writer who wanted to be famous but was not slovenly, at a writers' tea party, caught an excellent publisher, and chattered to tell him about his new thousand-page novel, scene by scene, the publisher. He tried repeatedly to stop him from going on, but he insisted on telling the whole story.
When he finally finished speaking, he breathed a sigh of relief and said, "It's really enjoyable to tell others about my works. I used to have a terrible headache, but now I don't have any pain at all."
"No, it still hurts," replied the publisher, "but now it's not your headache, it's mine."
