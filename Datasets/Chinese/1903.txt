Accompanying my wife to a mobile phone store, my wife likes the iPhone,
I asked him, "Do you like it?"
She said, "I like it!"
I said, "If you like it, watch it for a while!"
We watched it all afternoon, and my wife suddenly asked me, "Why don't you buy it for me when I like it?"
I replied: "The person who loves you is not necessarily the one who is willing to spend money for you, but the one who is willing to spend time with you!"
The wife nodded with tears in her eyes and said, "I just like you~ I don't have money, I pretend to be garlic, and I can talk nonsense!"
