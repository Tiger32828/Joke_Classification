On the eve of Valentine's Day, I was walking down the street and suddenly heard a man beside him ordering flowers from a flower shop on his mobile phone.
Girlfriend: "Look, how romantic they are, I don't have any"
Before he could finish speaking, he heard the man say again, "Send it to the second funeral home."
