The "public welfare lottery" is sold on the street, and the lottery is drawn on the spot. Anyone with an animal pattern printed on it will win a prize. The bigger the animal is, the higher the prize level.
One person carefully opened one and took a look, and immediately shouted with joy, "I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey!"
Then ostentatiously asked the person beside him what was the award? The person was repeatedly unable to get it, so he said angrily: "What are you shouting, as long as it is an animal, you will win the lottery!"
