Xiaomei is already twenty and eighty years old, and she has not yet married, so her mother and she are very anxious.
So her mother asked her to put a marriage notice in the newspaper, and the content of the notice was as follows:
Beautiful and healthy, demure lady, waiting in the boudoir, willing to communicate with a handsome man, and can get married in a short time.
A week after the newspaper was published, her mother asked her anxiously, "Did you have a reply?"
"Only one." Mei said with a sigh.
"Who wrote it to you?"
"I guess I shouldn't tell you?"
"But I told you the marriage proposal, you have to tell me!" Mom yelled.
"Okay! Since you want to ask, I have to tell you: the letter is from Dad."
