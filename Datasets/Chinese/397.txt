Tang Sanzang recently heard that there are new Buddhist scriptures in the West, so he called three disciples together.
Tang Sanzang: "I've decided to go to the West to learn scriptures, but I want to go there in a faster way. Do you have any suggestions?"
Sun Wukong: "Master Qibing, I heard that the high-speed train is very fast. Should we try it, it will definitely be much faster than your horse riding."
Zhu Bajie: "Master, no matter how fast the high-speed rail is, it is not as fast as a plane. I think it is better to take a plane, and I heard that there are meals on the plane to eat, so let's go by plane."
Tang Sanzang: "What the two of you said is very true, what do you think, third child?"
I only saw Sha Wujing pull out a pistol from his clothes...
Sha Wujing: "Master, I heard that this thing can be sent directly to the West. Master, do you want to try it?"
