British writer and critic G. Justton (1874-1936) was tall and well-dressed, with a dignified appearance, but he was born with a soft falsetto.
But he was not stumped, on the contrary, sometimes, he was able to create special effects.
Once he gave a speech before a trip to America.
Before the speech, the host introduced Justerton to the audience with flamboyant rhetoric.
Justton noticed that the host's introduction was too much and too messy, and the audience seemed to be impatient and tired.
So after the introduction, he stood up and said to the audience:
"After a whirlwind came a calm and gentle breeze."
