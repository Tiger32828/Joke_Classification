The potbellied Mr. Schmidt decided to welcome the new year alone in a restaurant. He sat in the corner of the restaurant and called the waiter,
He said, "Please send me a tall glass of vodka, a meatloaf, and to welcome the new year, you'd better send me a good congratulations."
After a few minutes, the waiter brought the wine and meat patties to Schmidt. Schmidt asked, "Tell me, what was your message for me?"
The waiter leaned over and whispered into his ear, "Stop eating the meatloaf, sir."
