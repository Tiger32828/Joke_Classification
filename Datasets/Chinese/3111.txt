A man named Bakiri bought a goat for 11 copper coins.
He carried the sheep on his shoulders and carried it home with both hands.
On the way, he met an old friend: "How much did you buy this sheep for?"
Bakiri didn't answer, just stretched his hands forward and used ten fingers to indicate "10",
He stretched his tongue out again, adding up to "11".
However, the goat on his shoulder had already jumped down and escaped without a trace.
