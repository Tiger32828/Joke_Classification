Son: Dad, I caused trouble today, and I made the teacher cry.
Dad: You little bastard, what happened to the teacher?
Son: I was playing with magnets in class, but the teacher found it and confiscated it.
Dad: It's nothing!
Son: But as soon as the teacher took it, she sucked it on her big gold bracelet and cried on the spot. She even ran to the principal to fight, scratching the principal's face and bleeding! I don't know why either...
Dad: Okay, it's alright, let's go play. Keep the magnet away from your mother in the future...
