One day, someone deliberately made things difficult for Pistarozzi, a great Swiss educator, and asked him a question:
"Can you tell from infancy what a child will become when he grows up?"
Pistarozzi replied succinctly: "It's very simple. If you are a baby girl, you will grow up to be a woman; if you are a boy, you will grow up to be a man."
