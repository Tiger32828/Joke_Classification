There is an old man who lives in a nursing home with Alzheimer's disease.
He asked the nurse, "What day is it today?"
The nurse replied, "Today is Wednesday."
After a while, he asked again, "Nurse, what day is it today?"
The nurse answered patiently, "Today is Wednesday."
After a while, he asked again, "What day is it today?"
The nurse wanted to say that he didn't remember the day of the week that he asked and that he didn't remember the day of the week, so he replied casually, "It's Friday."
The old man said, "Liar! You said it was Wednesday just two times before."
