The famous Victorian writer Bright had an alcoholic footman.
He fired the valet, and while writing his recommendation for him, said to him:
"I wrote in the letter that you are an honest and dedicated person, but I cannot write that you are calm and sober."
"Sir," said the valet, "can't you write 'often sober'?"
