Fischler is a famous joke king who can tell a joke in seconds.
Someone was very dissatisfied with Fischler and asked, "Can you tell a joke in one sentence?"
Fischler said, "There are a lot of jokes in one sentence! But I'm afraid you won't understand."
"Ha! I don't understand, what a joke," the man said.
