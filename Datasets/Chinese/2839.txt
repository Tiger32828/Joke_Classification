One day, "Aguai" from the second class came out of the shower, and someone in the first class asked her, "Do you have hygiene?"
"Aguai said, "Yes! Do you want a big one? Or a small one?"
The first class asked, "You take it all with you!"
Aguai said, "Yes!" He took out the "sanitary pad" (sanitary napkin).
At this time, I saw that group of people said: "I want to eat instant noodles..."
Aguai: "..."
P.S. This "chopstick" is not another "block"!
