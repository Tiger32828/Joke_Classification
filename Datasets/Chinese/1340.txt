One day a customer went to the beef noodle shop
Guest: "Boss! A bowl of beef noodles is a little more"
Boss: "Okay, come right away"
When the boss was making the noodles, the customer said, "Boss, the soup needs a little more~"
Boss: "Oh! The noodles are here"
Guest: "Boss, I want more meat"
The boss said angrily, "Then may I ask what you want less?"
Guest (with a very flat expression): "Money!"
