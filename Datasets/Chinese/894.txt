A scientist wanted to study penguins, so he went to the North Pole to visit a hundred penguins.
The scientist asked the first penguin: "What do you do every day?"
Penguin said: "Eat, sleep, play stuff."
The scientist thought to himself, "What is slugging?" So he asked the second penguin, "Penguin, what do you do every day?"
Penguin said: "Eat, sleep, play stuff."
When the scientist asked about the ninety-ninth, the answer was the same, until the last oneâ€¦.
The scientist asked the hundredth penguin: "What do you do every day?"
The penguin said, "Eat and sleep."
The scientist asked, "Why don't you hit Dongdong?"
Only the hundredth penguin said angrily, "Because I am Dongdong."
