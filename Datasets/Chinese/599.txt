Two sheep came to a new grassland to graze, and the big sheep took a bite.
The lamb asked, "What does it taste like?"
The big sheep replied: "Strawberry flavor."
The lamb didn't believe it. After chewing on it, he said in disappointment, "It doesn't taste at all!"
The big sheep said, "That's why I said grass is tasteless!"
