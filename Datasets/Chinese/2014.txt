A friend of mine worked in a crematorium, but he was fired after a while, and asked him if he knew why?
"I only said one sentence!" I thought, it turned out to be the wrong thing!
"What did you say?"
He said that when he was sent into the fire, he said, "Sir, how familiar are you?"
It turned out that he used to work in a steakhouse.
