When I was in elementary school, I often participated in speech contests. When I participated for the first time, I was only in the third grade. I was full of confidence and thought it was very easy to win the award.
So after memorizing the manuscript thoroughly, I went to the competition with complacence. On the stage, I politely said:
"Hello, teachers and students! What I want to talk about today is the story of "Chang'e Flying to the Moon". "
At the beginning, I said it well, but suddenly I started to feel hungry because of my nervousness, and I said:
"Hou Yi shot nine hamburgers..." The people in the audience laughed so hard, my fame was ruined like this!
Since then, the food I hate the most is called "hamburgers".
