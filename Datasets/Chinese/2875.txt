The Chinese teacher found that Xiao Ming was sleeping in class.
Very angry, so he woke Xiao Ming and asked, "How do you sleep in class?"
However, Xiao Ming refused to admit to sleeping. Xiao Ming: "I didn't sleep."
Teacher: "Then why do you close your eyes?"
Xiao Ming: "Teacher, I am reading the text silently."
The teacher didn't believe it and said, "Then why are you nodding?"
Xiao Ming: "Teacher, your lectures are very good."
The teacher still didn't believe it and said, "Then why are you drooling?"
Xiao Ming: "Teacher, your class is very interesting."
