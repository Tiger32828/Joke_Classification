Two old friends, Lao Ming and Lao Hua, meet every day in the park to feed pigeons, watch squirrels and discuss world issues.
One day, Lao Ming did not appear. Lao Hua thought about it too much, thinking that he might have a cold or something else.

But after a week, he still hadn't seen Lao Ming, and Lao Hua was really worried.
Since they all met in the park, Lao Hua didn't know where Lao Ming lived, so he couldn't know what happened to him. It was estimated that it had been a month since he last saw Lao Ming.

One day, Lao Hua approached the park... Look, isn't Lao Ming sitting there! Lao Hua was excited and happy.
"Oh, old Ming, what happened to you?"
"I was put in jail," said Lao Ming.
"Prison?" Lao Hua shouted, "What happened?"
"Oh," said Old Ming:
"Do you know that Ah Hua is the waitress with the wink and the buttocks that I used to go to the cafe?"
"I remember her. What happened?"
"One day she falsely accused me of rape. I was 87 years old, and I was so proud that I walked into the courtroom and confessed my guilt to the judge. The judge sentenced me to 30 days in prison... .. of perjury!"
