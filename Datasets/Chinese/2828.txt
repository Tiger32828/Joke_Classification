There was a sit-up test in a physical education class, and before I left after finishing the test,
Someone found the shoulder strap of an underwear on the ground, so he shook the shoulder strap and asked loudly, "Whose shoulder strap is off?"
And I also laughed and said, "Who is such an idiot!" As a result, I touched it,
I just realized that my shoulder straps seem to be missing! It turned out that the shoulder strap was mine!
I had to bite the bullet and claim it, and everyone in the playground laughed!
