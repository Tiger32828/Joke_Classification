A woman was on a plane for the first time and found a window seat and sat down.
As soon as she was seated, a man came to her and insisted that she had taken his seat.
She raised the ticket in her hand and said nothing, but the man was still chattering around.
She got on fire and yelled at the man to get out of the way.
"Okay..." The man sighed and said, "Since you insist, it's up to you to fly the plane."
