One day the teacher was teaching history and found Xiao Ming dozing off.
Teacher: "Xiao Ming, who killed Yue Fei?"
Xiao Ming: "I didn't kill it, ask me what I did!"
The teacher was very angry when he heard Xiao Ming's impolite answer, and called Xiao Ming's father to complain.
When Xiao Ming's father heard the words, he rushed to the school immediately. As soon as they met, he bowed to the teacher and escorted him. At the same time, he turned around and slapped Xiao Ming with a slap.
Said, "I didn't tell you that you have to be honest, you have to admit that you killed it."
