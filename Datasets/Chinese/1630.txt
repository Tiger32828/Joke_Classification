One day the president accidentally fell into the ditch, and three children happened to pass by.
The president said to them, "If you rescue me, I will give each of you a wish"

The first child said, "I want a bicycle."
The second kid said, "I want a baseball glove."
The third child thought for a long time and said, "I want a wheelchair."
The president felt very strange in his heart, why do you need a wheelchair with good hands and feet?

He asked the third child, "Why do you need a wheelchair?"
The third child said, "My dad would break my leg if he knew I would save you."
