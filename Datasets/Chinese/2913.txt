Once, a young man covered the eyes of his lover who was waiting on a park bench from behind, and said, "You are only allowed to guess three times. If you can't guess who I am, I will kiss you."
Guess what the girl guessed?
She opened her mouth and shouted, "Are you - Tony Leung? Chow Yun-fat? Andy Lau? Neither is right, then you win!"
