A man asked the farmer, "What do you feed the pigs?"
"Use leftovers and unwanted leaves," replied the farmer.
"So I should punish you." The man said, "I am a public health inspector.
It is against the law for you to feed animals that are not nutritious for the general public. A fine of ten thousand yuan. "
After a while, another neatly dressed man came up and asked the farmer, "What fat pigs! What are you feeding them?"
"Shark fins, chicken livers, seafood, etc." replied the farmer.
"Then I should punish you," said the man, "I am an inspector of the Institute of Food and Nutrition.
One-third of the world's population is hungry, and I can't let you feed pigs that good food. You will be fined 10,000 yuan. "
A third person came after a few months. Like the first two, he leaned over the farmer's fence and asked, "What do you feed the pigs?"
"Dude," replied the farmer, "now I give them ten dollars a day, and they can buy whatever they want."
