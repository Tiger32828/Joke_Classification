A parent took his baby son to a cram school to sign up to learn English, and he chose "He Jiaren" American English.
After class, the parents found out that it was not He Jiaren's "deity" in class, and they angrily took their children to the cram school service desk to scold, "Why didn't He Jiaren come out to teach He Jiaren's American language?"
The lady at the counter only replied coldly: "Does the giraffe have to teach the giraffe American English?"
