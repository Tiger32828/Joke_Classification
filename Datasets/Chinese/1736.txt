A buddy took his girlfriend to an Internet cafe, he was playing League of Legends, and his girlfriend was playing with his mobile phone next to him.
Later, his girlfriend was bored and all kinds of coquettish threats told him to leave,
In desperation, the buddy pointed to the computer and said to his girlfriend: I am just at level 30 now, and I will be at level 31 soon.
So his girlfriend waited for him in the Internet cafe for one night~~
In the end he wanted to leave, but she held him down: I won't leave until thirty-one!
