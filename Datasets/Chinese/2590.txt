A couple was driving past a farm in the countryside on a weekend break when the wife suddenly said, "Stop, darling! Let's do what we did here forty years ago again!"
The husband stopped the car and the two jumped out of the car eagerly. The wife leaned against the fence by the road, and the husband began to make love with his wife.
Soon, the wife began to shout excitedly, twisting her body, shaking involuntarily, and after finishing the incident, the wife actually passed out.
The husband was greatly surprised, and hurriedly took his wife into the car to rest. After a while, the wife woke up and turned around, and the husband was relieved.
He said, "My dear, you weren't as loose as you were forty years ago. In fact, in my mind, I've never seen you so loose."
"Forty years ago," the wife was still panting, "that fence wasn't electrified."
