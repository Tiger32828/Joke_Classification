Wang Xiaoming, his family lives in the countryside by the river with beautiful scenery.
The toilet in his house is a latrine built on the river. When the whole family runs out of convenience, the excrement can flow with the current and be flushed naturally.
One day, when Xiao Ming went to school, the teacher asked Xiao Ming in class, "Xiao Ming, who burned the Epang Palace?"
Xiao Ming: "Teacher, I didn't burn it, don't scold me!"
The teacher was so angry that she immediately called Xiao Ming's father after class.
Teacher: "Mr. Wang, look at your Xiaoming, you don't even know who burned the Epang Palace! He also said that he didn't burn it!"
Father: "Teacher, I'm so sorry. Our little Ming is stupid, but he's honest. He said it wasn't him who burned it, or it wasn't him who burned it."
The teacher didn't want to communicate with Xiao Ming's father any more, so he asked his mother to answer the phone.
After listening to the teacher's statement, the mother said, "Teacher, I'm so sorry, I'm going to scold Xiao Ming!"
Then the voices of scolding and beating children were vaguely heard.
After a while, Xiao Ming's mother returned to the phone: "Teacher, I'm sorry to keep you waiting for so long, Xiao Ming admitted that he burned the Epang Palace. This child, he just can't beat it..."
