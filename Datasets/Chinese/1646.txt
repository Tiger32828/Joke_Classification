In the troops fighting on the front line, there was a reckless and straightforward Master Chief who received news from the rear that the grandfather of one of his soldiers had died.
During the roll call, he said gruffly to the soldier, "Hey! Your grandpa is dead!"
The soldiers listened and cried out on the spot.
Later, someone complained to the superior commander that the Master Chief was ruthless, and the commander warned the Master Chief, "In the future, when something unfortunate happens in the family of the brothers in the army, we must inform them gently."

A week later, the Master Chief received another notice that the grandmother of a new brother named Ah Guo in his unit had passed away.
The Master Chief remembered the commander's instructions, so he gathered all the soldiers and said very gently, "If your grandmother is still alive, take a step forward...!" "Hey! Don't move!"
