A couple went shopping in a department store. The wife saw the ring she liked and pulled her husband over to look at it.
The husband asked his wife, "Do you really like it?"
The wife kept nodding her head, with pleading eyes. . . . . .
So my husband asked the clerk, "Excuse me, how much is this ring?"
The clerk said, "After discount, it's 8,888 yuan."
The husband was going to pay, but at this time his wife said, "I'll pay half the price if you are so considerate."
His wife took out 88 yuan and said, "Husband! I've paid half of it, and the rest is left to you...>_<
