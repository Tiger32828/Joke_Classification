She lay on the table and asked the tablemate:
"Hey, do you have someone you like?"
He glanced at her and said lightly, "Yes."
She felt lost for a while, but she still pretended to be indifferent and asked, "Who is it?"
"Our class, you guessed it."
She had guessed the names of the other girls in the class, but he shook his head.
He chuckled: "Fool, are you sure you've finished reading all your names?"
The girl was stunned for a while, then turned her head shyly and said nothing.
At this time, he softly whispered in her ear, "You haven't read the boy's name yet!"
