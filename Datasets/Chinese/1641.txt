It is said that a thief stole the bank, finally pried open the safe, and found that there was not a penny in it!
Instead, a few jelly was put in, and the thief was puzzled, but he couldn't think of it for nothing, so he ate the jelly.
The next day, Mr. thief bought a newspaper to see how much impact he could have by stealing the bank.
Hey~ actually made a headline: "The only sperm bank in our city was stolen last night!"
