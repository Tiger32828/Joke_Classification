There is a woman who is very sorry, even if she is ugly, she is not very eloquent.
Once, it was arranged for a blind date, but the male protagonist didn't show up for a long time, and the woman couldn't wait very impatiently.
He started yelling, "Wah Mile, how dare you make your mother wait so long..&%$&^$%#@!$!%"
Buli scolded a string of slaps, and at this time, the male protagonist appeared...a fat man.
This woman was even more angry when she saw it, so she scolded a bunch of slapsticks again, pointing at the male protagonist and scolding the dead fat man.
The male protagonist finally went crazy and slapped the table...
Say loudly, "Call me fat...at least I've been thin before, are you beautiful?"
