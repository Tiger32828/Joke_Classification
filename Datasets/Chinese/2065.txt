One time Dad Cai wanted to drive to Miaoli, but it was foggy that night, and he couldn't see anything.
Dad Cai wanted to say, "Alas! Just follow the rear lights of the car in front of you."
Open it! Open it! Suddenly hit the butt of the car in front!
Dad Cai opened the window and said, "Hey! Why did you suddenly stop in the middle of the road!"
The driver in front said, "Hey! Dude, I'm not parking in my garage, where do you want me to park? Besides, why did you follow me to my garage?"
