The king raised a horse, but the horse did not laugh or cry, so he offered a reward of 100 gold for whoever made the horse laugh.
One person said, "I'm going to challenge!"

The man turned to the horse and said, "My dick is bigger than yours."
The horse kept laughing and laughing.

The king was not convinced and said, "Then you can make him cry, and I will give you another 100 gold."
The man said, "Okay...but let me take the horse into the stable."

After the king agreed, the man took the horse into the stable.
The horse kept crying after coming out.

The king asked, "How did you make the horse cry?"
The man replied, "Nothing but let him look under me."
