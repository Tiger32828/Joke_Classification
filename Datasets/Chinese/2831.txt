In the morning, I woke up sleepy and went to school after breakfast.
When I step into the school, the cool wind blows............
"It's so elegant!" I was thinking so... Strange! Why does my stomach feel cold?
I looked down and looked down....... oh my god! My uniform only has two buttons!
Oh~~ The boy in front walked by with a blushing face, and the girl also looked at me with a half-squinted smile.
Done! The chastity of women has been ruined by me! Fortunately, it was only for a moment, I was confused, so I had to rush to the toilet to clean up my "grooming".
