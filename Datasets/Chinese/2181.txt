I said to the Buddha, "Let all my friends be healthy and happy forever!"
The Buddha said, "Only four days!"
I said, "Okay, spring, summer, autumn, winter."
The Buddha said, "Three days."
I said, "Okay, yesterday, today, tomorrow."
The Buddha said, "No, two days."
I said, "Okay, day and night."
The Buddha said, "No, just one day!"
I said, "Okay!"
The Buddha asked blankly, "Which day?"
I said, "Every day that all my friends live!"
The Buddha smiled...and said, "In the future, all your friends will be healthy and happy every day!"
