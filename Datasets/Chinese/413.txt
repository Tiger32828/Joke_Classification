A friend went to Taishan to play, and ordered a "cow ramen" in a small noodle restaurant, and found that there was no beef.
So I called the shop owner to reason and got the answer: "The noodle maker's last name is Niu!"
My friend almost fainted on the spot!
Q: Do you not consider long-term business?
The owner replied, "The average customer comes to Mount Tai once in their lifetime, and I am very lucky to be able to come to me to eat a bowl of noodles!"
