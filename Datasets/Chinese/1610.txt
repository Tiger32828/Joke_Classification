General Manager: "Beautiful ladies, guess a riddle? Listen carefully and guess an idiom! I really want, I want, I'm so excited, and I want to die, and as a result, water slowly starts to flow out of the hole. ."
"Alas! Omg! Such a shameless general manager." The ladies cursed in their hearts!
"What? Can't guess it! Hehehe!"
"That... that one will be very open?" Granny 38 asked pretending to be ashamed.
"That's right! And they've been wide open all the time. And there's more water flowing."
"I hate it! I hate it! It's not coming! The general manager is horny."
"Hey! If you can't guess, don't talk nonsense, the answer is "salivate"."
