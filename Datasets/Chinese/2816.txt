Once, because my mother had an emergency, my grandmother took her place in my school's "parent-teacher meeting".
I thought Grandma was getting older, and I was a little worried, so I sneaked to see it.
Grandma seemed to be too nervous. When the teacher asked questions, she was so nervous that she even fell off her dentures...
