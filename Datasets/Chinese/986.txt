One day, a patient entered the clinic
Patient: Doctor, please help me, my whole body is not right.
The doctor said without looking up: First of all, your eyesight doesn't seem to be very good.
Patient: Doctor, you are so powerful, how did you know?
Doctor: You didn't see the sign outside, this is the veterinary hospital.
