The chief nursing officer of the mental hospital explained the condition of each admitted patient to the visiting officials.
One patient held a photo in his hand and banged his head against the wall while crying.
The head nurse said, "He loved the woman in the photo so much that he wouldn't put it down whether he was awake or asleep, but the woman married someone else, and he went crazy because of it!"
At this time, a man in the next room also slammed his head against the wall.
The official asked, "What happened to him?"
The head nurse said, "He's the one who married that woman!"
