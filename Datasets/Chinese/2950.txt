Kissinger was once invited to speak.
After being introduced by the host, the audience stood up and applauded, and the applause continued for a long time.
The applause finally stopped and the audience sat down.
"I want to thank you for stopping the applause."
"It's hard to be humble for a long time," Kissinger said.
