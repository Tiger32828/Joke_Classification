Early in the morning, the wife asked Wang Laowu to get up for breakfast. She walked into the bedroom and saw her husband sitting blankly under the covers.
"Damn, get up for breakfast soon!" "I'm not hungry."
"How can you not be hungry?" The wife asked with concern, "You ate very little last night."
"So last night, I had a dream that I was in Lanzhou, and I also tasted Lanzhou noodles."
"But it was just a dream!"
"But I just found out that my belt was missing."
