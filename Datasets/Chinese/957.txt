Once in a mental hospital, there were two people...
One night, they decided not to stay in the mental hospital, so they planned to escape.
They climbed up the roof, over the narrow gap between the two buildings, and saw the roof of the town, stretching out in the moonlight...to the world of freedom.
The first jumped without difficulty, but his friend dared not. You know, he was terrified of falling.
So the first person came up with an idea, and he said, "Hey, I've got a flashlight. I'll turn on the light between the two buildings, and you can walk over on the beam."
But the second man shook his head and said, "What? Do you think I'm crazy? You're sure to turn it off when I'm halfway there."
