One morning when I took the MRT to work, a man and a woman sat in the opposite seats, kissing La Tong madly as if no one else was there, quite ecstatic.
What happened next left me completely dumbfounded.
At the next stop, as soon as a girl got in the car and saw the couple, she walked up to them without hesitation, and said to the boy coldly, "I'm pregnant"
The boy was at a loss, completely stunned on the spot, his face froze, looking at this pregnant girl, he couldn't say a word.
The girl sitting next to her was quite shocked. She looked at the girl first, then turned to look at her boyfriend, and then slapped her boyfriend, so angry that she couldn't speak.
Just when I thought there was a good show to watch, the pregnant girl spoke up again.
She said coldly to the couple, "I'm sorry, I mean I'm pregnant, can I have this fraternity seat for me?"
