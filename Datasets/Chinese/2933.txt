A single man proposed to his girlfriend, but was rejected. He felt sad and sighed in front of his girlfriend:
"Forget it, I don't want to get married in this life."
"Why are you so pessimistic?" The girlfriend said with great pity, "Why don't you have a wife, a husband, I rejected you, and it's unlikely that other girls would reject you too!"
"Of course," the single man still sighed, "but, even if you don't want me, who else would want me?"
