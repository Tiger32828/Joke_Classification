There was an American who was in line behind a college student when buying a movie ticket. The ticket saleswoman asked the college student in front to tell the foreigner in the back that there were only standing tickets left because she could not understand English.

To see if he wanted to buy it, the middle school student said to the foreigner:
"No seat, you see no see? if see, stand see."
(There is no seat, you can't watch, if you want, stand and watch)

After listening to the Americans, they said to the college students: "I don't understand your English."
When the college student heard it, he said to the ticketing lady, "He said he didn't understand English."
