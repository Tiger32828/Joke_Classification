After Xiao Ming graduated early, he helped out at the pharmacy at home.
One day his father was going out, so he said to Xiao Ming, "I'm going out, have you remembered all the names of the medicines?"
Xiao Ming said, "Remember, Dad, don't worry."
After a while, a professor came to the store, and he asked, "Is Your Honor there?"
Xiao Ming replied, "There is no such medicine as 'Ling Zun' in this shop."
The professor asked again, "Is Lingtang there?"
Xiao Ming replied, "There is no such medicine as 'Lingtang' either."
The professor knew that Xiao Ming didn't understand anything, so he waited for a while and left.
When his father came back, he asked if anyone came to buy medicine, and Xiao Ming told his father about the professor's visit.
After his father heard this, he slapped Xiao Ming and told him, "Ling Zun is me, and Ling Tang is your mother."
The next day, after Xiao Ming's father went out, the professor came again.
He asked again, "Is the commanding hall there?"
Xiao Ming immediately slapped the professor and said, "Ling Zun is me, and Ling Tang is your mother."
