There are Americans, Japanese, Koreans, Taiwanese on a plane that is about to crash...
The captain announced that in order to make a safe landing, the weight needed to be reduced and a person would need to jump off.

So the Americans showed their personal heroism, walked to the cabin door and shouted "Long live the United States of America", and then jumped off.
After the plane flew for a while, the captain once again announced that the plane was still too heavy and that a person would need to jump off the plane.

So the Japanese showed their Bushido spirit, walked to the cabin door and shouted "Long Live the Empire of Japan", and then jumped off.
After the plane flew for a while, the captain still announced that the plane was still too heavy and that one person needed to jump off the plane.

At this time, the Taiwanese looked at the Koreans and walked to the door of the cabin.
The Korean hurried over and clenched the hands of the Taiwanese, saying, "You are of the Korean ethnicity, right? I will never forget that you sacrificed your life for the great Korean!"
At this time, the Taiwanese shouted: "Long live the Republic of China!"

Then kicked the Korean off the plane.
