A blind beggar begging in the street wearing sunglasses.
A drunk man came over and felt sorry for him, so he threw a hundred yuan to him.
After walking for a while, when the drunk man turned his head, he happened to see the blind man facing the sun to distinguish the authenticity of the one-hundred-yuan coupon.
The drunk man came over and took the money back and said, "You TMD don't want to live anymore, how dare you lie to me!"
The blind beggar looked aggrieved and said, "Brother, I'm so sorry. I'm here to take a look for a friend. He's blind and went to the toilet. Actually, I'm dumb."
"Oh, that's it," so the drunk threw down the money and staggered away again...
