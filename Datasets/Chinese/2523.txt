One day, on a whim, the teacher of the third grade of a primary school asked all the children in the class to think about it. Someone in his home once said that sentence, which made everyone present at the time very excited.
The children who came to the stage should first write that sentence on the blackboard, and then explain the reason.
Children who speak well will get prizes; after all, the children chat a few times.
Xiaoying raised her hand first. She wrote "100 points" on the blackboard, and then said, "After I got home yesterday, I told my parents that I had 100 points in the Mandarin test, and they were very happy!"
Then, Xiaojuan took the stage and wrote "I love you" on the blackboard, and continued: "Last Sunday was my parents' wedding anniversary. During dinner, my father said to my mother, "I love you!" And my brother is also very happy! "
Then Xiaohua came to the stage, wrote "I won" on the blackboard, and then said: "Two days ago, when my mother was checking the lottery numbers, she suddenly shouted: "I won the first prize!" Our whole family got out of the chairs. Jumped up, shouted and danced for a while! "
After listening to the speeches of the three children, the teacher said, "Xiaohua speaks the best and can get a prize."
At this time, Xiaoxin raised his hand and said, "Teacher! I have better ones."
The teacher replied, "Okay! Xiaoxin, come on stage and tell everyone."
So Xiaoxin took the stage and wrote "I didn't come" on the blackboard, and then said, "Yesterday when our family had dinner together, my sister in high school said, "I didn't come!" Then, my father jumped with joy, and my mother I was so happy that I fell to the groundâ€”"
