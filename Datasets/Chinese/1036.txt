One afternoon, Ade was bored and picked up his mobile phone to play with. He remembered that it had been five years since he last changed his house number, so he dialed his old house number and wanted to know if that number was already used.
Not long after the call was made, a man answered the phone, and Ade said in a hurry, "Hello, I sell insurance, do you need anything?"
I thought that the other end of the phone would hang up immediately after hearing this, but the man replied, "Well, I'm about to buy insurance, please give me a detailed introduction!"
