A young girl walked into our bank to cash a large check.
She doesn't have an account, and her wallet was stolen a week ago, so she can't prove her identity.
Suddenly, she pointed to the phone and said loudly, "Please call my doctor, he knows the person with the name on the check has measles."
Then he pulled up his coat to reveal his waist and said, "Look, I have the measles."
Turns out we cashed her check.
