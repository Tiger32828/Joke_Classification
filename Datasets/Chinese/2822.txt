During the speaking class, it was my turn to come on stage and tell the story. As I speak with joy,
Suddenly - a mosquito happened to fly into my mouth and was caught by me. I was startled, blushed and shouted "Ah!".
That abominable dead mosquito actually "jumped alive" in front of everyone, and walked around in a leisurely circle before leaving at ease.
After watching the mosquito's performance, the whole class was quiet for about 3 or 4 seconds, and then everyone burst into laughter.
And I, under the persecution of that dead mosquito, blushed and stepped down.
