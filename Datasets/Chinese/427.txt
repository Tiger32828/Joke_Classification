During the Chinese New Year holiday, on the Sujiahang Expressway, there was a traffic jam for more than 6 hours.
A passenger driver finally couldn't bear it anymore, took out a long baseball bat, and jumped out of the car angrily,
Everyone in the car looked at him in amazement, and saw that he smashed a snail on the ground,
And he said loudly: "I have endured you for a long time! You have been following me since the toll booth, and now you dare to overtake my car!"
