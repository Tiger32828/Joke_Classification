A statistics student skips an entire semester to take the final exam.
The test was only true and false, so he took the test by tossing a coin.
The professor saw that the student spent two hours flipping a coin, writing the answer, flipping the coin, writing the answer.
In the end everyone completed the exam except this student.
The professor walked over and interrupted the student: "I think you didn't study hard at all, but if you flip a coin to decide the answer, why didn't you do it well for so long?"
"I'm still checking my answers," the student said bitterly.
