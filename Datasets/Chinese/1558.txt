Mother watches international basketball games on TV.
When the New Zealand team won, she mused, "Whether they eat beef, look how strong they are!"
In the next game, the South Korean team took the lead, and she said, "Ginseng is still powerful, it depends on how fast they move!"
When I came to the Chinese team, I was always at a disadvantage. My mother said anxiously, "Why didn't the coach give them ginseng stewed beef?"
