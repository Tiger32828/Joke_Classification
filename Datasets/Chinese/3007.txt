"Nature always rewards man. For example: if a man is blind in one eye,
His sight in the other eye will be stronger; if a man is deaf in one ear,
His other ear will become smarter. And so on. "
"I think you're right in saying that when a person has one leg shorter than the other, the other leg is always longer."
