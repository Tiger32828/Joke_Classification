One day, there was a meeting in a village, and 3 hours passed. Before the meeting was over, a middle-aged woman stood up and walked towards the door.
The village chief: "What are you doing, Anna, the meeting is not over yet."
Middle-aged woman: "I have children at home."
After 20 minutes, a young woman stood up again.
The village chief: "Where are you going, Lena, you don't have any children at home?"
Young woman: "If I always sit here in meetings, my family will never have children."
