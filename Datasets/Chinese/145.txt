One day, the President called the Executive Director and asked him about the administration. The President: "How is the computer education I want you to implement?"
Dean: "The effect is remarkable!"
President: "Okay! Let me ask you, will you send an E-MAIL?"
Dean: "Of course! Little Case... President: Okay, details!"
Dean: "First of all, you have to type the article on the computer.."
President: "President of the Right Concept"
Dean: "Save it on a CD.."
President: "What about next time?"
Dean: "It is very important to have the recipient's E-mail address"
THE PRESIDENT: "Um.. continue.."
Dean: "It's easy again. Buy envelopes, stamps, write your address, affix the stamps, and send the magnetic disks!!"
