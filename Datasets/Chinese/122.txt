A young couple who have just married recently received many wedding gifts from relatives and friends, some of which are very expensive, some of which are very practical.
Among them, there is an envelope, which only contains two movie tickets and a small note. On the small note, there are only five small characters: Guess who I am?
The couple thought for a long time, who would send them movie tickets? After thinking about it for a long time, I can't think of it.
"Forget it! Just don't think about it. Since they are well-intentioned, let's go to the movies tonight."
Mr. to Mrs. After watching the movie, when the couple came home, they were really surprised, because the house was visited by thieves and all the valuables and valuables were removed.
Finally found a note on the dining table that said: Guess who I am!
