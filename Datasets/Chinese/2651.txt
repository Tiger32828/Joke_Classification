An American woman went to a Chinese restaurant for the first time. After eating, the waiter brought a bill. She saw the square characters on the bill and thought it was both curious and beautiful, so she asked the waiter for one.
When she got home, she immediately embroidered those words on a new evening dress as a pattern.
A few days later, she was invited to a dance, so she went in that new dress.
At the dance, American friends praised the beauty of her clothes, especially the patterns on them.
But a Chinese person saw it and was shocked. It turned out that it said "good quality and low price".
