When explaining the word "miracle", a teacher gave an example:
"A man jumped from the eighth floor and was unscathed." He hoped the students would say the word "miracle".
A classmate replied, "Lucky." The teacher was disappointed, so he said, "This man climbed the eighth floor and jumped again, but he was still uninjured."
Another student replied: "By chance." The teacher was very angry, so he had to say: "The man climbed up the eighth floor again and jumped down again..."
Before the teacher could finish speaking, a classmate replied, "He's used to it."
