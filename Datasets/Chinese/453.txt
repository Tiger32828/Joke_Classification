The programmer asked the Zen master, "I broke up with my girlfriend of 7 years. Are there many programmers who have no relationship with love?"
The Zen master smiled without saying a word, pointed his hand to the beam in front of the programmer's gate, and saw a mother bird building a nest above it.
Programmer Dawu: "Master means that love shouldn't be forced. When fate comes, someone will naturally stay?"
The master closed his eyes and said, "No, it's my business to break up with you?"
