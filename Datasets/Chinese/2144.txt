One day, a colleague asked, "You usually go to work during the day. Who will bring your son?"
A Juan replied, "My mother-in-law!"
The colleague said enviously: "You are so happy!"
A Juan replied with a smile:
"It's okay! She helps me take my son during the day, and I help her take her son at night. It's fair, and no one takes advantage."
