"In 10 years, North Korean astronauts will be landed on the sun," Kim Jong-un announced while inspecting the North Korean space agency accompanied by reporters!
An American reporter asked, "How do you get up there when the sun is so hot?"
Suddenly the audience was silent, and everyone didn't know how to answer this question.
At this time, Kim Jong-un said slowly, "Let's go after dark!"
Suddenly there was thunderous applause from the North Koreans...

Trump, who was watching live TV, sneered and said to his colleagues around him:
"This idiot, it's dark and there's no sun at all!"
There was thunderous applause in the White House!
