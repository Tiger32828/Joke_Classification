A class holds a final exam, and the class will hand in the papers after 40 minutes.
And told the invigilator that because the class instructor has explained matters that need to be announced on the blackboard.
The invigilator did not suspect him, but the class representative wrote:
"Students 1, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13 have finished their exams, please find teacher Alex
2, 4, 6, 10, 15 go to Hall B to meet
3, 9, 16, 18, 20, 23 to wash the windows
The rest are left to sweep! ! ! ! "


Haha~ Why didn't we think of this trick in the first place...
