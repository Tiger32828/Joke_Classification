Two female colleagues in the office quarreled.
The manager couldn't bear it any longer: "That's outrageous! What's the situation now? Tell me why!"
As soon as the two heard it, they scrambled to each other and quarreled.
The manager yelled, "Enough! The fat one speaks first!"
Suddenly, the world was quiet.
