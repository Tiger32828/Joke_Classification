I squatted on the stool. After I finished, I found that I didn't bring any paper. I tried to clean it with my fingers and then wash my hands, but the stool was sticky.
So I tried hard to shake it off, my finger hit the edge of the squat pit, it hurt so much, and the conditioned reflex covered my finger with my mouth...
