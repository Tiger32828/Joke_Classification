There are four passengers on a plane. A politician, an entrepreneur, a priest, and a backpacker.
Unfortunately the plane broke down and the pilot said, "I'm going to try to make a forced landing, but you have to jump off the plane first."
Unfortunately, they found that there were only three parachutes on the plane. That's when the politician said, "I have the support of many fans, so I can't die." Then he put on a parachute and jumped out of the plane.
Then the entrepreneur said, "I have countless employees who depend on me to support the family, so I have to explain to them." And jumped out of the plane.
The priest said to the traveler, "I am a believer in God, and I am not afraid of death. You can use the rest of the parachute."
Backpacker: "Hey, Father, we still have two parachutes. The entrepreneur just jumped out with my backpack on."
