A married man was in the office one day, and suddenly a strange man came to visit...
The stranger said, "Last week, you took your female secretary to the south for an affair, didn't you?"
Married man said: "What are you doing!"
The strange man took out a large stack of photos and said, "I have secretly photographed the whole process, what are you going to do?"
The married man looked at the photos one by one and said, "Okay, I'll add one of them all!"
