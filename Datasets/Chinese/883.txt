When I was shopping, I suddenly felt a pain in my stomach, so I walked into the 199 all-you-can-eat hot pot restaurant on the corner...
I wanted to borrow a toilet to use, but I couldn't find it on the first floor, so I ran to the second floor!
The second floor is still being renovated and empty with nothing!
But I found that there was a toilet with a sign "Failure to be repaired, please do not use"
I really couldn't help it, no matter what, no one was around anyway!
Take off your pants and squat down on the toilet
crackling... so cool! !

after the endâ€¦
I went downstairs and found no one!
Strange, it was dinner time, and the downstairs was full of friends just now!
Why do people go to the building all of a sudden? Even the waiters and receptionists are gone...
So I approached the bar,
And asked: "Is anyone there? Why is there no one?"
At this moment, I saw a male waiter get out from under the bar,
And he opened his mouth and said, "I'll do it!... The stool fell from the ceiling just now. Were you not there when the fan hit? You're lucky..."
