A man saw a police car slowly approaching while driving, and immediately stepped on the accelerator to the end to accelerate and escape.
The police immediately chased after seeing this. After a life-threatening chase, the police finally stopped the car and found that there was no criminal record for driving.
Policeman: "You didn't commit a crime, why did you run?"
Driver: "My wife ran off with a policeman the other day. I thought you were the policeman and wanted to send my wife back to me, so I was scared."
