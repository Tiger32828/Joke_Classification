Judge: "I can't believe no matter what, such a decent, serious man can beat a petite and fragile woman like your wife."
John: "But she scolded me, tortured me, and completely lost my patience."
Judge: "What did she say?"
John: "She shouted, 'Come on, hit me, I'm not afraid. Come on, when you come, if you dare to touch me, I'll drag you to that bald old fool, the judge.'" "
Judge: "This case is dismissed."
