There was a high school student in our school who ran 1 minute slower than the Olympic record of 5000 meters.
Everyone praised him as a rising star in the sports world, and many media came to interview him.
Why is my result only 20 seconds slower than the 100-meter world record, everyone laughs at me as a dead fat man! ?
