There is a person who often scores more than 200 points every time he bowls, and often hits a turkey.
One day he went bowling with a friend, and he didn't even hit a turkey for six innings, so he was in a bad mood...
As I rode home, I kept thinking why didn't I play turkey today? He stopped at a red light halfway through the ride. At that time, a car next to him also stopped. The driver rolled down the window and asked, "Sir, do you have a lighter?"
He replied angrily, "No! It's none of your business if you don't play turkey!"
