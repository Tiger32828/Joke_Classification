A lawyer in India's Supreme Court cited a British case as a rationale when defending his case.
"How can an English case be cited in an Indian court?" the judge asked the defence lawyer:
"British law is as different from Indian law as trousers are from Indian loincloth."
The defense attorney pondered for a while before retorting, "However, your Lordship will understand that the original intention of the two is the same."
