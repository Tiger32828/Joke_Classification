It is said that after Noah's Ark, many species are left with either one or two.
And the lion, the king of the forest, was too arrogant at the time, so only one little lioness was left on the boat, and the others were drowned in water!
After the flood receded, many animals found their homes, and this little lion didn't know what a home was because it was too small.

It became friends with the monkeys that strayed together and had "Childhood (Little Lion Monkey)".
After a while, he saw that he looked very similar to a dog, so he went to call his husband's dog daddy, and the puppy certainly refused to let it go, so there was "Lion King Fighting for Hegemony (Lion Wang Fighting for Dad)".
Although the little lion had beaten the puppy, he was bitten back by the dog's father. It was very depressed and told about his experience_x0008_, so there was "unfortunate teacher".
Later, it was adopted by a human and gradually acquired some human characteristics. When it was free, it liked to roll in the batter, so there was the "Sphinx".
After that it learned to speak, so there is a "oath".
It also began to use pillows at night, so it had "eczema".
Of course, no one could understand what it said, and everyone thought it was crazy, and everyone rushed to tell each other, "Crazy Heart (Lion New Crazy)".
People started to call it "rheumatism".
Slowly it began to develop, and it began to know that it was smug. If it was okay, it would put gold paper on its body to increase its luster, but it was very ugly, so there was "Golden Gold is not beautiful (lion gold is not beautiful)".
When it matures, it wants to have a family and starts saving money to build a house to find a man, so it has "private money".
Later, when it got old, people called it "teacher".
When it was dying, no one of the opposite sex had touched it. It was very depressed and stood on the river bank and shouted "I want a man", so there was "Hedong Lion's Roar".
