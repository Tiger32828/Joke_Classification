When I was in middle school, one day I was preparing to have a meal for lunch, and I couldn't think of the boy I had a crush on,
It was right behind me, and when I was nervous, I knocked over the rice!
When I squatted down to check, who knew that a gust of wind blew again,
I lifted my skirt up, I tried my best to block it with my hands, but it was too late,
All were seen by him! Not only that, but I also fell so hard that my whole body was covered in rice. …
It was the most, most, most humiliating day of my life, I really don't want to live......!
