Xiao Ming quarreled with his wife, and in a fit of rage, he beat his wife severely, and his wife went to court as soon as she complained.

Judge: "Xiao Ming, why did you beat your wife?"
Xiao Ming: "Because my wife said I'm not like a man, in order to prove that I'm a strong and healthy man, I beat her, but I regret it now. I hope she can give me a chance to rehabilitate."
Judge: "Gu Nian, you are the first offender, and you are full of remorse. I will forgive you this time. The husband and wife are arguing at the head of the bed, and the end of the bed is harmonious. Go back and reflect on it."
Xiao Ming: "Thank you for the grace of not killing, I will definitely be a new person."

Unexpectedly, Xiao Ming's wife accused Xiao Ming of beating her the next day.

The judge took over the lawsuit and was very angry.
Judge: "Xiao Ming, you don't believe what you said, you intentionally hurt, and you don't even take me seriously. I decided to sentence you to a severe sentence."
Xiao Ming: "Injustice! My lord. I beat my wife because I respect you very much."
Judge: "What do you mean?"
Xiao Ming: "Yesterday, after we left the courtroom, my wife kept scolding the judge, calling the judge you tortoise bastard. You don't distinguish right from wrong, you have no courage, you only have the kindness of a woman, and you actually let me go unpunished. Is it a man? This kind of statement is a great insult to you, the judge, so I said: "The judge gave me the opportunity to reform, and I don't remember the old evil. This is the great hero and the highest wisdom." "What a great hero, I think it is Bear, what is the highest wisdom, it is stupider than a pig, he will have no asshole in the future..." Hearing her insulting the judge like you, I couldn't bear it any longer, so I gave her another meal."

Judge: "Listen to you, you did the right thing, played well, acquitted."
