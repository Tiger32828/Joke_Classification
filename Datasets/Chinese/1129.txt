One day, the husband took his wife back to her parents' house.
On the way, the wife said to her husband, "Husband, do you remember that before we got married, we played the game of kissing me every time we stopped at a red light?"
Husband: "Remember~"
Wife: "Then let's play again now, shall we?"
Husband: "Okay~"
Then my husband drove the car onto the highway.
