The company's business is booming. In response to the huge business volume, the general manager decided to recruit female secretaries. Finally, five young ladies participated in the interview...
In order to test their character, the general manager came up with a very simple question: 1+1=?
Let the HR director ask them to answer one by one

The first interviewee came in, and the HR director asked, "1+1=?"
She answered very quickly: "2"
General manager's comment: "I am very decisive, but I lack thinking!"

When it was the second person's turn, the HR director asked, "1+1=?"
She thought for a moment and said, "It should be 2."
General manager's comment: "Think before doing things, but indecisive when making decisions!"

When it was the third person's turn, the HR director asked, "1+1=?"
She thought about it and wrote it on the paper: "1+1=King"
General Manager's Comment: "Very creative, but lacks pragmatism!"

When it was the fourth person's turn, the HR director asked, "1+1=?"
"The number is 2, and the national character is king," she said.
Manager's Comment: "Well thought out, but blurs the real focus!"

At the fifth place, the HR director asked, "1+1=?"
She said, "The number is 2, and the national character is king, but the real answer is only known to the manager. As long as the manager wants 2 to be 2, the hope is that the king is of course the king!"

Personnel Director: "This lady is always good, right?"
Comment from the general manager: "Everything is good, but there is suspicion of flattering!"

Seeing that the general manager seemed dissatisfied with the candidates, the HR director had to ask these young ladies to go back and wait for the notification. He asked the general manager embarrassedly, "Which candidate should the manager decide on? They are basically doing well!"


General Manager: "Just the one with the big breasts in the miniskirt!"
