Teacher: "You're finally here! Why didn't you come to class yesterday?"
Student: "My mom fell down the stairs..."
Teacher: "Oh! That's right. Mom was hurt so you didn't come."
Student: "No...my dad got hurt..."
Teacher: "Why did your mom get hurt when your mom fell down the stairs?"
Student: "Because...my dad has a woman outside..."
Teacher: "What? ..what does that have to do with your mother falling down the stairs?"
Student: "Because they were fighting.. It's okay for my mother to fall. My father was injured by my mother."
Teacher: "Oh...then you didn't come to class because you took Dad to the hospital?"
Student: "No... it was sent to my dad by a woman outside."
Teacher: "Then why didn't you come to class?"
Student: "Because I overslept..."
Teacher: "What does that have to do with your mother falling down the stairs!?"
Student: "No, ah...I just mentioned it by the way.."
