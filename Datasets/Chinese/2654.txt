On rainy days, many people asked to sit in the cabin, which was particularly uncomfortable.
Among them, Zhang San brought a basket of spiced beans and ate them by himself, because the spiced beans were so fragrant that everyone salivated.
One of the guests couldn't bear it any longer, so he asked Zhang San for a few grains to eat.
Zhang San: "It's okay if you want to eat beans, but I have the conditions. If anyone can tell an ancient story, I will give him one, otherwise don't think about it."
Guest A: "Qin Shi Huang unified the world. This is an ancient story."
Zhang San: "Very good, please take one."
Guest B: "Liu Guan and Zhang Taoyuan have three ties."
Zhang San: "Yes, this is a story of three people, please eat three!"
Guest B not only wanted to eat beans, but also wanted to eat a few more beans, so he said, "One hundred and eight generals in Liangshan Park, I want to eat one hundred and eight!"
Zhang San was a little embarrassed, but he had already said the words, and it was inconvenient to break his word, so he had to count his teeth.
When Ke Jia saw that others had eaten so much, he was the one who opened the mouth first, but only ate one grain, so he said to Zhang San, "Cao Cao's 830,000 people went down to the south of the Yangtze River and wants to eat 830,000 grains, please give them all to me. !"
