The third child is the youngest at home. Since childhood, the third child has been very dependent on his mother.
Until the wedding day of the third child, the bride and the mother of the third child went back to the room first because they were tired from the banquet, and the new house was connected to the room of the third mother.
The third child returned to the bridal chamber drunk and found that the door was locked by the bride.
The third child shouted in a hurry: Mom! can't open
Mom: try harder
Third child: Mom.. still can't open
Mom: Try harder
The third child: Mom.. I really can't open it
Mom: lick it with your tongue
The third child: Mom... can't open it either
Mom also said anxiously: hit it with the head
The third child hit the horn lock with his head hard: Mom.... bleeding
The mother of the third child said happily: It's good to bleed.. Really good son...
