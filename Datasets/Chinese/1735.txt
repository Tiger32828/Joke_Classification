Peter has been insomnia at night, listless at work, and almost had an accident.
He went to the hospital and asked the doctor, "Doctor, I have neurasthenia. I want to sleep very much during the day, but I can't sleep at all at night. Look, what method can I use to treat me."
Doctor: "It is very simple and easy to cure your disease."
Peter: "What's the trick?"
Doctor: "From now on, you will be working night shifts."
