Someone takes a bus to Gao Chao Village, Jiading District, Shanghai
Since I hadn't been there, I started asking the female conductor after the second stop, "Has the climax reached?"
The conductor replied, "No."

After two stops, someone asked again, "Has the climax reached?"
The conductor replied, "No."

After a few minutes, someone asked again, "Has the orgasm reached?"
At this time, the female conductor was really impatient.
"The orgasm is here, and I'll scream!" replied loudly.

As soon as the voice fell, all the passengers in the car turned their heads and turned their eyes to the female conductor...
