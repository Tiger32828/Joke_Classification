One day, the history teacher was in class. The teacher asked the students, "Who can tell who Zheng Chenggong was in history?"
A student stood up and said, "I don't know who Zheng Chenggong is, but I know who his mother is!"
The teacher said, "How do you know his relatives?"
The student said, "Yes, his mother is called failure! Didn't the teacher always say that failure is the mother of success?"
