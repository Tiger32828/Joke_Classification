For business reasons, a contractor is going to bribe a congressman with a new limousine.
The congressman said with a straight face: "Sir, the usual code of conduct and my own basic sense of honor do not allow me to accept such a gift!"
The contractor said, "Your Excellency, I understand where you stand. Come on! I'll sell you this car for $10."
After thinking for a moment, the MP replied categorically, "If that's the case, then buy two."
