Three statisticians went hunting and came across a rather large deer. The first statistician fired, but the bullet was about a meter to the left.

The second statistician followed suit, but also missed, and the bullet was 1 meter to the right. The third statistician put his gun down and exclaimed, "Hey, on average, we hit!"
