One day, Xiaomei and her boyfriend drove out for a drive,
The car was about to run out of gas, and there was a gas station next to her. As she drove past, a gust of wind blew away her boyfriend's hat.
Xiaomei's boyfriend said to her, "I'm going to pick up a hat, you cheer me on."
As soon as her boyfriend ran away, he heard Xiaomei shouting from behind him: "Come on! Come on!"
