In the gas station, the working students held their cheeks in their hands and thoughtfully,
A man came over and asked him, "Young man, what are you thinking?"
The working student said, "I want to be a singer."
The man patted his shoulder and said, "Come on!"
The working student said excitedly: "Thank you, you are the first person to encourage me, I will work hard."
The man yelled, "I'm encouraging you! I'm telling you to "fuel" my car!"
