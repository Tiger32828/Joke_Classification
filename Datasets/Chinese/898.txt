One day, three local tyrants from the United States, the Philippines, and Taiwan were chatting by the river.
When the topic turned to who was richer, the Americans took out a bunch of bills from their pockets, threw them into the river very lavishly and said, "This is a lot of my family!"
Not to be outdone, the Filipino local tyrant grabbed a handful of jewelry from his pocket, and threw it into the river without changing his face, saying, "This is my family too!"
This time the Taiwanese tyrant panicked, because there was no valuable treasure in his pocket...

Suddenly the Taiwanese pushed the Filipino into the river in one breath and proudly said, "There are many in my family!"
