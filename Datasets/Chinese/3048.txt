There was a man named Wang Wencheng who was recently knighted by the imperial court, and one of his colleagues was very envious.
Once, when Wang Wencheng went to court, he wore a hat with dangling sides to cover his ears.
When the colleague saw the joke, he said, "Is your ear cold, sir?" Wang Wencheng replied, "I don't have a cold ear, but your eyes are hot."
