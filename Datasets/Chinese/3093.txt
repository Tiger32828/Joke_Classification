During a trip at sea, the boat the Duke of Wellington was in was caught in a storm and was in danger of sinking.
The captain hurried to Wellington's cabin and said, "Duke, the boat is flooded, and we're finished."
Wellington was about to go to bed when he said, "Okay, then I don't have to take off my shoes."
