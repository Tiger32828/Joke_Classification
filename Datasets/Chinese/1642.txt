Xiaoying saw her mother smearing her face and asked, "Mom, what are you doing?"
Mom: "I'm putting on a mask!"
Xiaoying: "Why do you want to put on a mask?"
Mom patted Xiaoying's head and said, "This way my mother will be more beautiful!"
After a while, my mother picked up the tissue and wiped off the mask.
Xiaoying asked curiously, "Mom, what's wrong with you? Are you discouraged?"
