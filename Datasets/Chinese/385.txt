When the husband came home, he said to his wife in a rage:
"Oops! I offended your dad!"
"How come? Didn't you have dinner with my dad and his guests today?" the wife asked.
"Yeah, when I was eating and chatting, I talked about a dog fighting against people. As a result, I was choked on the food when I only talked about the human character, and became a dog man..."
"Really? Then did you explain it quickly?" The wife was also very anxious.
"Yes, your dad asked me: Are you talking about me? Then I swallowed the food and said the last word: Shi (yes)."
