When my husband was dating before we got married, he wanted to kiss me very much, so I asked...
When driving, he kissed me every time he stopped at a red light. After I agreed, every time he drove me, he chose those Zhongshan Roads with a lot of traffic lights, and Wufu Road to drive.
After getting married, I suddenly remembered this incident, so I asked him to kiss me every time he stopped at a red light as before, he readily agreed, but I found out that...
He drove the highway home!
