Before the class was dismissed today, the teaching assistant quoted a poem by Du Fu: "When you read thousands of volumes, you can write like a god."
Let's encourage students to study hard and do the basic skills well, so that they can be like God's help in the future exams.
The bell rang after class, and before leaving, he answered the students' questions at the desk. After a while, he looked back and saw the blackboard...
Those two sentences have been changed to "Book A breaks ten thousand volumes, and it is like a god in bed"!
