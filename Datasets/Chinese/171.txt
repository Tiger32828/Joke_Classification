One day, Mao Mao said to her grandmother, "Grandma, I want to eat pizza",
I didn't expect my mother to say no!
"No matter what, I must eat it!!!"
"no!!"
"I want it!!!" Followed by Mao Mao who was full of tears and snot.
Grandma couldn't bear the cry of her dear baby grandson's crying father and mother.
He had to follow Jin Sun's wishes and reluctantly dug a nose and stuffed it into his mouth...


ps: How can grandma understand English.......Han Sun.......
