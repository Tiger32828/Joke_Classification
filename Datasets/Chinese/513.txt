When I went to the ATM to collect money, I saw a note on it that said
"Don't plug it in"!
I thought to myself, idiot who is so good at plugging the ATM...
Then I carefully inserted the card, the ATM didn't move, and I couldn't pull out the card, and I didn't know what to do...

Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I caught sight of the note, which said "Don't, it's broken."
Whoa~ Can you make a big joke with a little bit, who can see if you're a little bit so funny!
