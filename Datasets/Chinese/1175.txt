After dinner, I read the newspaper in the living room and asked my wife, "Did you wash the dishes?"
The wife said seriously: "Husband, you should ask, 'Baby, let me help you wash the dishes!'"
Then I said, "Husband, it's already washed. It's so obvious..."
So, I said, "Baby, let me wash the dishes for you!"

Wife: "Well, let's go."
