Iron-blooded Prime Minister Bismarck once made an appointment with a judge to go hunting,
When the two were looking for animals, a white rabbit suddenly ran out of the grass.
"That white rabbit has been sentenced to death." After the judge said so confidently,
He raised his shotgun, but it missed, and the white rabbit jumped and fled.
Seeing this situation, Bismarck immediately laughed and said to the judge: "It doesn't seem to be convinced by your judgment, and it has already gone to the Supreme Court to appeal."
