The few times I went to the doctor, I saw a woman in the waiting room trying to restrain three naughty children.
Every time she was about to lose her temper, she took out a piece of paper from her handbag, and after reading it, she seemed calm and smiled knowingly.
I finally asked her one day what was written on the paper.
She showed me the clippings, which read: "The Guinness Book of World Records records that the woman who gave birth to the most children had sixty-nine children. Among them were sixteen sets of twins, seven sets of triplets, and four sets of quadruplets. "
