A classmate is renting a house outside,
He wanted to make a good impression on the landlord's aunt, so he made it up and said, "You know what? Auntie, when I moved out of the house I used to live in, the landlord cried and wouldn't let me go."
The landlord's auntie said, "Don't worry, nothing like that will happen here. I have to pay the rent in advance."
