Postman: "Registered, stamped."
Xiaoying was watching TV, so she called her brother: "Dad's letter, call it Daddy."
Brother: "No!"
When Xiaoying saw her younger brother disobeyed her orders, she immediately put on the air of a big sister: "If I tell you to go, you go, what are you talking about."
The younger brother had no choice but to run to the door and call the postman "Dad".
