Wang Laowu became ill due to excessive drinking. The doctor said, "This is like two axes chopping wood, which is harmful to one's body. In the future, he must stop drinking and quitting."
The wife glared at the doctor from the side. The doctor quickly changed his mind and said, "Even if you can't control sexual intercourse, you still need to stop drinking."
Wang Laowu said, "When I was young, I heard people say that having sex is more harmful than drinking alcohol. Now I think it is more important to quit sex first."
The wife immediately scolded: "Damn! You don't even listen to the doctor, do you still want to live?!"
