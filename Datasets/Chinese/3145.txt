Deputy Marshal Adams of the British Air Force reported that the Battle of Britain was drawing to a close.
I was called to a meeting at Fighter Command Command. I was driving, and there was a sign on the road blocking it:
"The road is closed - there is an unexploded bomb." I asked the policeman on duty if there was any other way.
He came up to me and said loudly, "Sorry, you can't go there, the bomb could go off at any time."
He walked to the car, saw my uniform, took a few steps back and said:
"I'm sorry, sir, I didn't know it was you. You can go there, no problem."
