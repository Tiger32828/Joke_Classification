In a university in the north there is a bronze statue of Jiang Gong riding a horse.
I heard that Lien Zhan ran to admire the statue one night, and Duke Jiang suddenly said, "Lian Zhan, Lien Zhan."
Lien Chan: "Yes, Lord Jiang, please say it."
Jiang Gong: "Lian Zhan people know the righteousness, I have already heard about it, can you do me a favor?"
Lien Chan: "Yes, I will do my best next time."
Jiang Gong: "Then I'll be blunt. My horse has been with me for many years, and it should be retired. Can you help me change it?"
Lien Chan: "Yes, I must bring it here immediately."
Lien Zhan found Jiang Gong's statue talking, and immediately ran to explain to Lee Tenghui.
Li Tenghui didn't believe that Jiang Gong could speak after being killed, so he followed Lien Zhan to see the statue, and it didn't take long for Jiang Gong to speak again.
Jiang Gong: "Lian Zhan, Lien Zhan, I told you to bring a horse here, why did you bring a donkey here?!"
