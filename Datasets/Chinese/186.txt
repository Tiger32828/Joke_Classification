On a ghostly night...
The door of Xiaolan's house opened with a "Boom!"!
I saw Xiao Lan's mother running into the house with tears in her eyes.
Little Lan's dad, who has been staying at home: "Ah, what happened to your mother, why are you crying like this?"
Xiao Lan replied, "Because... we went to the school's ghost moon horror makeup competition, and Mom got the first place..."
Little Blue Dad: "First place! Not bad!"
Xiao Lan: "But... Mom is here to watch the game"
