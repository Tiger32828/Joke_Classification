Yi Kuo Shao asked the waiter at the hotel, "How much tip do you get at most once?"
"$100," the waiter replied.
Mr. Kuo immediately took out $200 and handed it to the waiter: "Next time someone asks you who tipped you the most, don't forget to mention my name. By the way, who gave you the $100?"
"You too, sir," said the waiter.
