One day, Xiao Guo received an instruction from Mazu in a dream to invite the statue of Mazu home, but because he was on a plane, Xiao Guo was a man, and if he put it on his thigh, he would be disrespectful to Mazu.
So Xiao Guo bought a seat for the idol, put the idol in the position, fastened the seat belt, everything was ready, just waiting for the plane to take off!
But... The plane didn't take off for a long time. When Xiao Guo was feeling impatient, he heard the stewardess's broadcast: "Miss Lin Mo Niang, Miss Lin Mo Niang, please board the plane as soon as possible when you hear the broadcast."
