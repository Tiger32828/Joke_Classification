In a certain section exam, the whole class was extremely poor in all subjects, especially the "English" subject, which was so poor .
I don't know which smart classmate has filled in the name of a teacher of a certain subject in the name column.......
So, when the tutor picked up the test paper, he blurted out and cursed: "Su XX, you come out! You actually got the lowest score in the whole class, let's see how I fix you!"
Immediately, the whole class burst into laughter, and the teacher stood there dumbfounded...
