Once, P, the world's first tenor, and D, the world's second tenor, met on the street.
The first tenor P, who is an Italian, showed off to the second tenor D, who was a Spaniard: "I was singing in a church in Spain last week, and halfway through the singing, the Spanish audience suddenly shouted: "" Ah! The miracle happened! The miracle happened!” I turned my head and looked behind me, and I saw two lines of tears streaming down the face of the statue of the Virgin Mary.
"Oh? What a coincidence." The second tenor laughed and said, "It's a coincidence that when I was singing in a church in Italy, halfway through the song, the Italian audience suddenly pointed behind me and shouted: "Ah! Miracle! Miracle!" I turned around and saw Jesus come down from the cross, took my hand, and praised sincerely, "That's great! You sing really well! Much better than that fat Italian who made my mother cry in Spain last week.”
