One afternoon, it was raining heavily, and I was on Zhongzheng Road with my classmates.
As a result, three or four fire trucks passed by, and they heard the conversation of a group of seventeen or eighteen-year-old high school students nearby.
A: "It's raining so hard. How could there be a fire. Why are the fire trucks out?"
B: "Why are you so stupid, of course the fire trucks come out to fill up water!"
