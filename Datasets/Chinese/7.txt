A bank manager goes to wash the car,
The owner of the car wash asked him very curiously, how does your bank make money?
He immediately replied that it was mainly achieved by the three major sectors of credit business, intermediary business and asset business.
The boss looked puzzled and asked him to explain in a simple way.
He thought about it and said: it is usury, arbitrary charges and pimping. The boss was relieved after hearing this.
