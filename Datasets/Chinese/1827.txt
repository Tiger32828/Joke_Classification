A young girl was traveling in a T-shirt with two big and strange numbers: "99"
When a foreigner saw it, he wanted to praise the dress for its good looks, but he was not very good at Chinese, so he forgot how to pronounce 9 in Chinese.
In desperation, I had to point to her clothes and say, "You two nine nines are so beautiful!"
