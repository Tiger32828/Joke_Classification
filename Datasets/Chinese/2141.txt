Final exams are held at Columbia University.
After one section of the exam, three students hurried into the classroom, only to find that they were late, and annoyed, they hurriedly asked the professor to let them make up the exam, and explained the reason for their lateness: because the car they were sharing was in. The tire is punctured, so it's late...
The kind professor promised to let them make up the exam a week later. The three students were very happy and went home to study hard, and then went to take the make-up exam a week later.
There is only one question on the test paper: May I ask which tire broke in the car you shared last week? As a result, the three answers were different!

In the end, all three were taken!
