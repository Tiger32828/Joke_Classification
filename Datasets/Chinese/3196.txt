At the Peeling Evangelistic Conference, the pastor talked about the joy of heaven and described it very well.
A student asked, "I don't believe that heaven is so good, and you haven't been there."
The pastor replied, "Brother, have you ever heard that some people who went to heaven came back because of too much suffering?"
