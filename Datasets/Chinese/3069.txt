Once upon a time, there was a blind man, a deaf man, and a lame man who went to the theatre together.
The three of them watched the play and commented on how well the play was performed. The blind man said, "Today's play, I sang very well, but my outfit was not good."
Sheng Zi said, "You can't see it. In fact, the outfit is very good, but it's a pity that the singing voice is too low."
The cripple took it and said, "Both of you are both right. In fact, today's performance was good, and the outfit was good, but unfortunately the stage was a little crooked."
