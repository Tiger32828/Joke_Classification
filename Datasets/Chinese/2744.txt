In the bar, Wang Laowu is drinking beer freely...
Suddenly I felt the need to go to the toilet very much, but I was afraid that someone would come to drink my beer after I left, so I wrote a note on the table: "I spit in the wine glass."
When Wang Laowu came back, he found that the note had been added: "I also spit out a mouthful."
