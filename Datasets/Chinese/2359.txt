I suddenly remembered what happened when I was in college.
Classmate A, male, has had a crush on C in my dormitory for a long time, so I texted him to confess and said, "I fell in love with you the first time I saw you."
C: "When did you first see me?"
A: "On the first day of school, I saw you coming to school with your family. Your dress was so pretty!"
C: "I didn't wear a skirt that day, the one wearing a skirt was my mother!"
