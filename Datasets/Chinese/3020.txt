Someone was walking in the desert for most of the day, smoking with thirst.
As he was about to leave the desert, he encountered a salesman who persuaded him to buy a tie.
He said, "You can do it, I'm so thirsty I want to tear my shirt off, and what tie should I buy!"
The salesman was bored and walked away.
The poor man finally found a bar in a small town on the edge of the desert,
He couldn't wait to meet the waiter at the door and said, "Give me something to drink!" His throat was almost hoarse.
"Sorry, sir, no one without a tie is allowed in." The waiter politely declined his request.
"what?........."
