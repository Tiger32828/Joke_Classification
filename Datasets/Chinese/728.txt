A rich father had three sons, the eldest and the second were unfilial, so they were all kicked out of the house by the father.
Only the third child was very filial, so his father kept him.
But not long after the third child took care of his father, his father died suddenly. Both the eldest and the second felt that it was a conspiracy for the third to seize the birth by himself, so they rushed home and tried to reason with the third.
When they see the third child, they yell at you, you are really "filial to the dead".
