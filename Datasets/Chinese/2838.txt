That year, I was the class president.... At the time, I was obsessed with the novel, and the whole class was buried in the notes.
Suddenly, the teacher rushed in in shock and shouted, "What are you doing? The whole school is waiting for you, do you know?"
Done! I, the confused monitor, completely forgot about the "flag raising"! died! The whole class didn't go out to line up to raise the flag!
I hurriedly assembled the team and went out. When I went out, all the teachers and students in the school were staring at me...I really wanted to find a hole to jump in....
As a result, the reputation of "confused monitor" stayed with me until graduation.
