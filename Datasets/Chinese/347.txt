There are three death row inmates A.B.C about to be executed

The warden wanted to ask them, what last wishes they could do? Apart from asking for their release

A said without hesitation: I want a bulletproof vest
Warden: Yes, the warden shot him in the head

B thought about it and said: I want a bulletproof helmet and a bulletproof vest
Warden: Of course there is no problem, the warden will hang B to death

C thought for a while and said: I want to see my grandson
Warden: But isn't your child married yet?
C said: It's okay, I can wait!
