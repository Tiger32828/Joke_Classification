The day before yesterday, I saw my nephew and nephew playing mahjong together. They were 7 years old and 6 years old...
Specifically, this is how to play...

The nephew threw one of my sister's bras on the sofa and shouted, "Two cakes!"
Then the nephew threw out two of my sister-in-law's bras and yelled, "I touch!"
Then the two boys rolled on the ground laughing...
Which fucking pervert taught them to play?
