One day in class, I suddenly had a stomachache, so I reported to the teacher and rushed out.
As soon as I got to the toilet, I started squatting on the toilet. I didn't expect constipation, and it took me a long time to come out.
When I got out of the toilet, I felt very relieved, and I started dancing without realizing it. I danced casually.
When I jumped around the corner, the PE teacher just came over and faced me,
I thought the teacher would scold me, but he said, "You dance well!" The students in the nearby classes also came out to see...
It's over, I'm famous!
