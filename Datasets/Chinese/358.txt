In class, the teacher said that he could measure words, and one of the classmates wrote the word "trouble".
After the teacher read it, he smiled and said, "You must have been scolded by your parents!"
The classmate said, "Wow! Teacher! Why are you so good? You'll know it at once!"
The teacher said, "Don't worry! I'll explain it to you slowly--
First of all, we use a differentiation to remove the cover of the word "hemp" in "trouble", isn't it left with "forest"?
Then use quadratic differentiation to remove the "fire" of the word "trouble", and then remove the remaining "page"
The top of the word is also removed, isn't it left with "Bei"?
From "Limbe", you can see that you were scolded by your father!
Also, for the remaining "Bei", you differentiate it again and remove the lower part to get the "eye",
Then "Lin Mu" means that you have also been scolded by your mother! "
