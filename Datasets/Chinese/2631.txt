A young lady was playing golf on the Freshwater course for the first time, and her caddie spent most of her time looking for the ball in the haystack or in the woods.
When she hit about the eighth hole, she finally couldn't help it, and asked angrily, "Why do you keep looking at your watch? Now you don't need to control the time."
"That's not a watch, ma'am," the caddy replied quickly. "It's a compass."
