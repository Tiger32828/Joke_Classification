There was a pig farmer who was feeding the pigs with leftovers. One day someone from the Environmental Protection Agency came and asked him, "What should I feed the pigs?"
The pig farmer said, "Leftover food." As a result, he was fined for "animal cruelty".
After that, the pig farmers fed the pigs to eat the delicacies of the mountains and the sea. Another person from the Environmental Protection Bureau came and saw the pigs eating the delicious food.
He scolded the pig farmers: "Africa is suffering from muscle shortages, and it is so good for pigs to eat", and was issued a "food waste" ticket.
Finally, the pig farmers came up with a solution, and another person from the Environmental Protection Bureau came and asked, "What do pigs eat?"
The pig farmer said, "It's not good to eat this, and it's not good to eat that. I'll give it 500 yuan to let it eat by itself."
