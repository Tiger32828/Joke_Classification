In French history, Georges Clemenceau (1841-1929) was a famous "Tiger Prime Minister".
He is known for his tough attitude in governing the country and handling foreign affairs. Colonel Clement told others about a past story, which can quite show his diplomacy.
On a trip to the East, a merchant sold him figurines. Clemenceau liked it very much and asked how much it would cost.
The merchant said, "I will sell it to a gentleman like you for seventy-five rupees." But Clemenceau thought it was too expensive, and he countered the price to forty-five rupees.
The merchant wanted to add a few more rupees, but Clemenceau would not budge. Finally, the merchant couldn't hold on anymore, waved his hand and said, "I can't help it! It's better to sell it to you than to give it to you."
Clemenceau replied bluntly: "A word is settled." He took the statue and said:
"Thank you for your kindness. But for accepting such a precious gift, I should have something in return." After that, he took out forty-five rupees and stuffed it with the merchant.
