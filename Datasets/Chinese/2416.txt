There are four women on the golf course who compose a group of swings, and they also chat during the round, discussing how to use golf-related terms to describe what kind of men they like.
The first woman said, "I like guys with good drivers."
Everyone asked, "Why?"
The woman replied, "Because it is strong and powerful!"
Everyone applauded.
The second woman said that the light is strong and powerful, if the skill is not good, what's the use?
"I like guys who are good at approaching the short game because of the skill!"
Everyone agrees.
The third woman said, "Strong, strong, and skillful, what's the point of not making a hole all the time? I like guys who putt well, that's cool!"
Everyone applauded again.
The woods, the approach short game and the putter are all finished, and everyone is looking at the fourth woman. What can I say?
The fourth woman said without hesitation, "I like men who hit OB."
Everyone is very strange, how can you like a man who plays OB?
She then said faintly: "This way you can do it again!"
