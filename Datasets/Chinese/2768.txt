When Dr. Tom's clinic moved, the assistant helped him put the skeleton in the back seat and told the driver to start the car.
The car stopped at the red light, and the assistant found the driver looking strangely behind the car, explaining: "I'm about to take it to the doctor."
The driver shouted at the assistant: "Miss, I have to remind you that it is too late to do this."
