Mingzheng is a naughty child. He is most afraid of painting, especially birds.
One day, the art teacher drew a bird standing on a branch on the blackboard as a sample for the students.
Mingzheng painted left and right, but the old paintings didn't look like the old ones. Seeing that all the classmates had submitted their papers, he also submitted them in a confused way.
The art teacher looked at his painting, picked up the pointer and slapped it on the blackboard in a puzzled way, and said, "Where's the bird you painted?"
Mingzheng replied quickly, "I was scared away by you."
