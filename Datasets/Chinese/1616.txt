People = eat + sleep + work + play,
Pig = eat + sleep,
Substitute: human = pig + work + play,
That is: people - play = pig + work
Conclusion: people who don't know how to play = pigs who can work

man = eating + sleeping + making money
Pig = eat + sleep
Substitute: man = pig + make money
Namely: pig = man - making money
Therefore, men who do not make money are equal to pigs.

Women = eating + sleeping + spending money.
Pig = eat + sleep.
Substitute: woman = pig + money
Namely: woman - spending money = pig.
Conclusion: Women who don't spend money are pigs.

In summary:
Men make money to keep women from turning into pigs!
Women pay to keep men from turning into pigs!

in conclusion:
man + woman
= (Pig + Make money) + (Pig + Spend money)
= two pigs
