One day, David came out after a magic show and was intercepted by someone. The thief took out a pistol and pointed at David and asked him to take out the money. With a flash of magic eyes, David turned his pistol away.
The thief took out the knife from the pocket again, and David turned it away.
David said, "Whatever you take out, I'll turn it away."
But how could the thief give up and take out the scissors to frighten him again. Unfortunately, David's magic was superb, and the scissors disappeared in the blink of an eye.
Seeing that the thief was wrong, he hurriedly fled...
The thief ran and said, "Today is really unlucky, I met a stinky magician, and even the begging tools have been changed, and the smaller one is counted...suspicious!? Suspicious!!!???"
