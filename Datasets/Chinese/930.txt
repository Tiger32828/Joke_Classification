One day two employees were chatting
Employee A: "The boss gave a really good speech today, especially when he said that the company is like a machine,
And when each of us is as important as a screw, I think he is really a good boss, and he values ​​us so much! "
Employee B: "But you may have forgotten that screws are important, but...easy to replace!"
