A student: "Teacher, let me ask you a question!"
The teacher said, "What's the problem?"
The student said, "Teacher, listen carefully! If you are a bus driver and there are thirty-eight people on the bus, at the third stop, nine people get off and three get on; at the fourth stop, one person gets off and two people get on. One person gets on the bus; at the fifth stop, three people get off and one gets on the bus, so what is the driver's name?"
The teacher replied, "How do I know the driver's name?"






The student said, "Teacher, look, you just don't pay attention. I said at the beginning, you are a bus driver, how could you not know the driver's name?"
