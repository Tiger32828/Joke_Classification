Four American business tycoons are on vacation in Paris, meet by chance at a club, talk about everything, and agree to speak out about their shortcomings.
A: "My shortcoming is that I am addicted to gambling." B: "Loving the things in the cup is my shortcoming."
C: "I'm too vicious with loan sharks. In the future, I want to do some charity work to make up for it." Finally, it was Ding's turn to speak. He hesitated to say it.
He was forced to say: "My shortcoming is that I like to fiddle with right and wrong. I wish I could fax back to New York what you just said right away, so that my friends will know as soon as possible."
