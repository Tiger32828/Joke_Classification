In class, the teacher asked a student to explain "form is emptiness"
The students stand up calmly:
"According to Ohm's law V = IR (Volt voltage = current x resistance),
Multiply both sides by A to get AV=AIR, and get "form is emptiness". "
The whole class was speechless, and then the applause continued for a long time!
