When a young woman buys a lottery ticket, she asks the master to help her choose the number.

The master pointed and asked:
"How many times have you gone abroad?" "Four times."
"How many children?" "Two."
"How many books have you read this year?" "5."
"How many times do you have sex with your husband every month?" "Twice (the young woman blushes)."

Master: "How many times have you had an affair?"
Young woman: "What? I'm a woman from a good family."
Master: "The last number is 0, and your lottery number is 42520."

The winning number was announced three days later as 42529.
The young woman regrets: look, fuck it, just don't lie!
