A businessman who was born and raised in Taipei City went to the countryside to talk business. On the way back, he saw a farmer pulling a calf protruding from the body of a pregnant cow, so he came forward and offered to help.
After the farmer told him a few tricks, after some struggle, the two finally worked together to pull the calf out of the cow.
"Thank you!" the farmer said to the New Yorker. "How can I thank you?" "You're welcome, but I have something to ask."
The New Yorker asked, "How fast was the calf when it hit the cow?"
