The little girl Yu'er's childish words always make everyone wonder whether to laugh or cry.

Case 1
When the little girl Yuer saw the business card of her colleagues in the company when she was five years old, she came to me very excitedly and told me, "Dad is a good man."
When I was suspicious, she said, "His name is Wang Tumu~ Okay, write it well!"

Case 2
When the little girl Yuer was two years old, the whole family ate fried rice with spicy bamboo shoots. After eating, she said, "I want soup."
I said, "No soup"
She said, "I want to drink no soup!"

Case 3
When the little girl Yuer was two years old, after the whole family had eaten, her mother took out dried dried plums as dessert.
She took a bite and immediately said, "There are bones in it!"
