A couple wanted to test their son's future career trends, so they placed a Bible (religion), a $10 (business) and a bottle of wine (social) on the living room table, and hid behind the door to peep.
When the son came home, he found the items on the table, looked around to make sure that no one was there, picked up the dollar, took the Bible, picked up the wine bottle, and walked straight into his room as if nothing had happened.
The couple exclaimed, "Oh my god, he will be in politics in the future!"
