Before a business trip, a friend's wife kindly gave him an Apple smart watch.

After a business trip, my wife picked up her watch to check the heartbeat APP record, and said to him leisurely:
"Traveling is exciting, isn't it?
My heart rate is around 80 during the day, but why is it above 120 at night?
My heart beat was over 130 for a few minutes! And then down to 80?
If your heart rate can't reach 130 tonight, give it a try! "
