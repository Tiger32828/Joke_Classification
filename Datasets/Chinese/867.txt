A Taiwanese man went to a bookstore to buy a book and asked, "Where is "Friendly Cross-Strait Relations"?"
The clerk said, "This book is a fantasy novel, and it's in the first row."

The man asked again, "What about "The Way of Getting Along Between the Two Straits"?"
The clerk said, "This book is a martial arts novel, and it's in the second row."

Man: "What about "The Essentials of Increasing Friendship and Joining the United Nations"?"
Shop clerk: "That's delusional syndrome. It's a mental illness. It's in the eighth row."

Man: "Where are the books like "How to Profit from Governing," "Reducing Food Costs," and "Increasing Operating Profits?"
Shop clerk: "In the judicial crime category, the last row..."

Man: "Do you have a book called "Service Trade Does Not Affect Politics"?"
The clerk smiled and said, "We don't sell fairy tale books here."
