Husband: "Honey, since you love me so much, why didn't you agree immediately when I first proposed to you?"
Wife: "Because I want to see how you reacted after rejection!"
Husband: "Oh! But what would you do if I turned around and left?"
Wife: "Don't worry! You can't go out because I locked the door long ago."
