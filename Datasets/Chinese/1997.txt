The general and the adjutant were ready to retire. The general said to the adjutant, "Just come to my house and be a housekeeper!"
Adjutant: "Yes! General!"
General: "Tomorrow morning, like in the army, wake me up at six o'clock!"
Adjutant: "Yes! General!"

At six o'clock the next day, the adjutant came to the general's bedroom on time. Adjutant: "General! It's time for you to get up!"

The general was very satisfied and felt that he had regained the feeling of being a troop.
Just as the general was about to praise the adjutant, the adjutant lifted the quilt and patted the general's wife's butt!
The adjutant shouted, "Beautiful girl! It's dawn, you should go home!"
