A truck driver walked into a restaurant, asked for food, and sat down.
At this moment, three young men in leather jackets appeared outside the door.
They jumped off the speeding motorcycle and entered the restaurant,
One stole the trucker's hamburger, one picked up his coffee,
One ate his apple pie... The truck driver paid and left without saying a word.
After the three boys finished eating and drinking, they walked up to the lady at the counter and said, "He doesn't look like a good man."
The lady at the counter said, "He doesn't look like a good driver either. Look, he's smashing three motorcycles outside."
