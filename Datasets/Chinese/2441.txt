Once, a banker asked the famous French writer Alexandre Dumas (1802-1870): "I heard that you have a quarter of black blood, don't you?"
"I think so!" said Dumas.
"What about your honorable man?"
"Half black blood."
"Where's your ancestor?"
"It's all black," replied Dumas.
"Excuse me, where's the great-grandfather?" The banker broke the casserole and asked to the end.
"Ape," Dumas said solemnly.
"Your Excellency is joking? How is this possible!"
"Really, it's an ape." Alexandre Dumas said happily, "My family started with an ape, and yours ends with an ape."
