A Qiang always dozed off in class.
The teacher couldn't bear to wake up the comatose A Qiang,
He asked him, "In the tortoise and the hare race, do you know why the hare lost?"
"I don't know," Ah Qiang replied sleepily,
"Because the rabbit is dozing off," the teacher said angrily,
"Oh! I understand." If Aqiang realized something,
"It turns out that all the people who didn't doze off were turtles!"
