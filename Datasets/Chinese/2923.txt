Father: "Sarah, why aren't you married yet?"
Sarah: "Dad, I have found several boyfriends, but they are not satisfied. Wait for me to choose again."
Father: "You're not too young, so hurry up!"
Sarah: "Don't worry, Dad, there are plenty of fish in the ocean of life!"
Father: "Son, the bait will lose its taste after a long time."
