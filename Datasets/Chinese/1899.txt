The bus arrived just now and I'm about to get off
In front of me is a grandma
he carried a heavy suitcase
Turns out he couldn't drag that suitcase a bit.
I see it all in the back
My heart hurts a grandma is getting old
Will his body endure this torture?
I was crying sadly behind
I finally couldn't help crying out
"Come on, mama!"
Suddenly the whole car shouted
Come on, mama, you can do it
In the end, it took Grandma five minutes to drag the suitcase out of the car by herself.
Taiwanese are so passionate
Stop saying that Taiwanese are indifferent.
