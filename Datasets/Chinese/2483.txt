A customer sits at a table in a fancy restaurant with a napkin tied around his neck. The manager was disgusted,
A waiter was called and said, "You go and tell the gentleman that in our restaurant, that's not allowed. But try to be as tactful as possible."
The waiter came to the man's table and asked politely, "Sir, are you shaving or getting a haircut?"
