On a Friday night on the 13th, the man driving the taxi was circling the street as usual.
At this time, a woman with long flowing hair, white face and white clothes appeared in front of him, calling for a car. The man didn't think much, and stopped the car: "Miss, do you want to go there?"
"Xinhai Tunnel, the second funeral home." The woman replied in a thin tone. "Wow..." There was a chill on the man's back.
Although he was afraid, he was safe along the way and arrived at his destination safely.
However, an unbelievable thing happened: the woman disappeared instantly when she got out of the car!
The man probed around to look around, but he still couldn't find the trace! Just as I was about to step on the accelerator and leave, suddenly! A hand reached out of the window and grabbed the door!
Then, a thin and weak voice appeared: "Mr. Driver, please help! When parking, don't park by the ditch!"
