Professor deserves to be a professor
In a university class, the professor wrote down the FTP server on the blackboard for students to upload and revise their papers.
I saw that the professor wrote down the password very calmly: cptbtptpbcptdtptp,
Everyone suddenly had three lines on their heads. Of course, this was not a climax.
A classmate asked, Professor, how do you remember such a long password?
I just heard the professor say: "Eat grapes and don't spit out grape skins, don't eat grapes and spit out grape skins"
