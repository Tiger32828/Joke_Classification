Recently, a piece of news has been circulating among young people that there is a "safe swimming guide" on the street.
So, when people got together in twos and threes, they discussed, "Let's hurry up and learn how to swim safely."
The school has started, and everyone is sitting in front of the teacher, wondering what kind of Fa study it will be, and they are panicking!
The teacher respectfully took out the pen and ink from the back room, and drew horizontal lines on everyone's knees.
Said: "I sincerely hope that you will never go under the water deeper than this line!"
