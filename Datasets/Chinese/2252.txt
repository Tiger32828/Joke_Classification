A man followed his girlfriend to a nightclub and found her hugging with other boys.
The man was so angry that he took a bottle of liquid and said, "I will disfigure you!"
When I splashed it on my girlfriend's face, there was no tingling, but the others ran away in fright!
Girlfriend asked angrily: "What the hell did you spill?"
The man replied: "Cleansing oil"
