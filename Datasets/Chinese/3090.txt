Sigismund (1368-1437) was appointed monarch of the Holy Roman Empire in 1411.
Once, he was talking about the philosophy of life at court.
A minister asked him: "In this world, people are so fragile and inevitably die, so how can we obtain more lasting happiness? Is there any secret?"
Sigismund answered confidently: "Of course, that is, long-lasting happiness is obtained by doing when you are healthy and doing what you have to let others do when you are sick."
