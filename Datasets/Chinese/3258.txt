Yaqing has a three-year-old son named Junzai. One day, she found Junzai standing by the window, waving and saying, "Uncle, bye!"
Since they lived on the second floor, Yaqing disagreed, thinking that Junzai was talking to passers-by outside the street,
But later found out that Junzai does this almost every day around dusk, but no one is outside the window.
Yaqing began to feel that something was wrong, so he asked Junzai who he was saying goodbye to, and Junzai said, "Tell me to my uncle."
Yaqing asked in surprise, "Is there an uncle outside?"
I saw Jun Zai pointed out and said, "It's that Uncle Sun."
