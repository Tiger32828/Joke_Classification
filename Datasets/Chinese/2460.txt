A dog pounced on a farmer, and the farmer, unable to bear it, killed the mad dog with a fork. The dog's owner sued the farmer and asked him to pay for the damage.
The judge said, "If you turn the fork upside down and use the toothless end, won't you be fine?"
The farmer replied, "That's right, Mr. Judge, if the dog came upside down on me, I'd do that!"
