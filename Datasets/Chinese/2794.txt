The housekeeper, Mrs. Chen, told the newly appointed priest that his house needs to be renovated:
"Father, your roof needs repairing, your water pressure isn't working, and your boiler is broken..."
Father "Mrs. Chen" reminded her: "You have been here longer than me, why not talk about "our" roof and "our" boiler..."
A few weeks later, the priest was in a meeting with the bishop and other clergy, when the housekeeper rushed in:
"Father, it's not good!" she muttered. "We have a giant cockroach in our bedroom, right under our bed!"
