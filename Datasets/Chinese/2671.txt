One day, a friend came to have dinner with Newton. The dishes were on the table, and Newton had not yet come out of his study.
His friend knew about Newton's habits, so he sat down and waited for him. After waiting for a long time, he thought that Newton must be thinking of some new principle and forgot the time, so he started to eat the chicken on the table.
When he was done, he wanted to play a joke on Newton, and he carefully put all the chicken bones back on the plate, put the lid on again, and left Newton's house.
A few hours later, Newton came out of the study, and when he felt very hungry, he saw that the food on the table was ready, so he sat down at his old seat and prepared to eat.
When he took off the lid and saw that only a plate of hard bones was left, he was very surprised.
He looked back at the clock and realized that it was long past his usual meal time.
"Ah! Ah!" he said to himself, "I thought I hadn't eaten yet, but I've already eaten."
He got up and left the dining room, walked back to the study and went to work, thinking that he had eaten at the usual time, and then completely forgot about the missed meal.
