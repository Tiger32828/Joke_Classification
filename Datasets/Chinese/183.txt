One day, a neuropathy was walking on the road and met two people
The neurotic pointed a gun at one of them and said, "1+1=?"
Passerby A, who was still in shock, said: "Equal to 2"
Neurotic shoots and says, "You know too much"
He pointed to another person and said, "1+1=?"
Passerby B said without hesitation: "3"
Neurotic shoots and says, "Too much!"
