A construction worker was carrying things on the site, a little at a time, and the foreman had to speak.
The foreman said to him in a corrective tone: "What do you think you are doing? Look at people carrying such heavy things!"
"Well," said the worker, "if they're too lazy to move as many times as I do, I can't do anything about them."
