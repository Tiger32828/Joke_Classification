Two brothers were convicted of homicide in the outside world and were sentenced to the Supreme Court... and their parents were worried that the court sentence would be too harsh, and even taught the two brothers to say...
Parents: You have to let everyone in the court know that you are patriotic, maybe the judge will give a lighter sentence
(So ​​their parents taught them to sing an "Ode to the Republic of China", and they said: When the judge makes a judgment, you must sing more beautifully...)
At the courthouse the next day... Judge: Where did you kill people? Two people: "Grassland of Qinghai" Judge: How many people did you kill?
Two people: "I can't see it all at a glance" Judge: Where did you put the body? Two people: "Himalayas" Judge: Oh! in those places?
Two people: "The peaks are connected to the horizon" Judge: Oh! That killed those people?
Two people: "Ancient Sages and Sages" Judge: Then what did you kill for?
Two people: "Build a home here" Judge: Under what circumstances did you kill?
Two people: "The wind and the rain hit" Judge: It's really cruel! How long have you been killing people?
Two people: "standing for five thousand years" The judge asked the next person: which country are you from? Prisoner: "Republic of China"
Judge: What about you? Prisoner: "Republic of China" Judge: Do you know that murder is to be sentenced?
Two people: "stands the test" Judge: So how many more people will be killed? Two people: "As long as the water of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers continues"
Judge: How long will it take to kill? Two people: "For ever and ever" Judge: .... um.. death penalty......
