It is said that there used to be two people, The Flash and the Invisible Man.

One day, The Flash was walking on the street, and suddenly he saw a very beautiful woman at the entrance of the alley, with her feet open for some reason.
A ghost idea appeared in the Flash's mind, so he rushed over at the speed of lightning, 'haha' dozens of times from behind the woman, and slipped away at the speed of lightning after the 'haha'.

The next day, The Flash heard that the Invisible Man was hospitalized.
The Flash went to the hospital to see the Invisible Man, found his lower body covered in bandages, and said, "Wow! What did you do with the Invisible Man? How did you get hurt like this?"
The invisible man said: "Alas... I used my invisible body to 'have sex' with a very beautiful woman at the entrance of the alley yesterday, but I don't know why, something stabbed my ass dozens of times at a very fast speed. ..."
