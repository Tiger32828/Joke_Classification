One day there was a terrifying math quiz, maybe I was too nervous,
Not only did he scratch the test paper, but even the eraser flew out, and the classmates in the next seat in K evenly rolled along the aisle all the way to the podium.
In a hurry, I shouted without thinking, "Ahâ€”hurry up! Help me find my other half (Zhuzi)!"
After I finished speaking, I became the focus of attention of the whole class; I had to endure the ridicule while holding the broken test paper, while laughing awkwardly.
