A group of tourists sit in a viewing bus and watch the tigers outside in the African Wildlife Area.
A rich man said: Whoever dares to get out of the car and run around and come back alive, I will give him one million dollars
As soon as the words fell, someone jumped out of the car and ran desperately for a lap. He was chased by the tiger and couldn't breathe, and finally climbed into the car.
Everyone was busy congratulating him and congratulating him on his $1 million.

But seeing this man, he asked angrily: Who pushed me out of the car just now?
Looking back, I saw his wife smiling (hahaha)(hahaha)(hahaha)(hahaha)

Behind every successful man,
there is an excellent woman,
At the critical moment, I can push you
