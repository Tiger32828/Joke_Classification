There is a dummy, his locomotive is often stolen, even if it is a used car, it is still stolen.
One day he suddenly thought of how to prevent the locomotive from being stolen again, so he added 4 locks and posted a note "See how you steal",
So he was happy to go to dinner. When he came back, the locomotive was not stolen,
When he was about to laugh, he found a lock and a piece of paper "See how you ride".
