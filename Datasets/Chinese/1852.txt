There was a university professor,
In the physics exam, he came up with a question that he thought was very satisfactory:

There is an old question: how many cherubs can fly on the needle of an embroidery needle?
Answer this question with the following information:
Each cherub should dance in a circle the same size as a gold atom.
The needle is flat and round, and the flat surface area is equal to the surface area of ​​100,000 silver atoms.
Please clearly state all assumptions.

After the exam......................
The professor found a student's answer while changing the test paper and had to give him full marks.
The man's answer is:
"I assume there are no angels in this world, so the answer is zero."
