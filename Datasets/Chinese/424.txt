A man ran into the temple on the mountain and immediately found the abbot and said sadly:
"My Buddha is merciful...Master, I have seen through the mortal world, and I no longer have any attachment to this world. Please shave me!"
The master walked slowly beside the statue, took out a long broom and slammed it on him, and said angrily:
"Fuck me! You come once a month and say you want a shave! How much does it cost to go to the barbershop for a haircut?"
