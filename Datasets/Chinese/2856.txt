I usually wear a shower cap in the shower; once, after a shower, I forgot to take it off and went out.
Walking in the alley at that time, many people were laughing at me, and I don't know why?
Suddenly a neighbor came up to me and said, "You wear a shower cap like a granny with white hair..."
At this time, I remembered that I forgot to take off my shower cap, my face turned green in an instant, and I rushed home quickly.......
