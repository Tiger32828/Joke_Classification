A large class of students just finished taking a group photo. The tutor tried to convince the children to buy a group photo each.
The teacher said to the children, "Think about when you grow up and come back and look at this photo, you can say: That's Dahua, she's a lawyer; this is a big head, he's a doctor. You say how good it is."
Suddenly a small voice came from the children: "Look, this is the teacher, she is dead."
