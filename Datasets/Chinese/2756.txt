In the 33rd year of the Republic of China, when Zhang Laojiu first arrived in Hanzhong, he was followed by a beggar as soon as he got off the carriage. He waved his hand impatiently and said, "Go, I don't have any change!"
The beggar held the abacus in one hand and his pocket in the other and said, "I have it, I have it, I'll find it for you!"
