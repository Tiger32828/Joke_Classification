A young man asked the Zen master for money:
"Master! I have an ideal to realize, and I need some money. Can you do me a favor?"
The Zen master took out a pair of children's gloves and headgear and asked the young people to put them on.
Then ask, "How do you feel now?"
Young man: "It's a little tight."
Zen Master: "Me too."
