One day the king was going to choose a prime minister on the condition that he was "not afraid of his wife".
So the king took advantage of the early dynasty and asked the civil and military officials of the whole dynasty: "If you are not afraid of your wife, stand on the right, and if you are afraid of your wife, stand on the left."
With an order, all but one of the generals stood to the left.
The king was very happy and asked the general why he stayed on the right, was he not afraid of his wife?
At this time, the general said: "Report to the king, I stayed on the right side today. When I went out in the morning, my wife said that there were too many people there, so I was not allowed to go there."
