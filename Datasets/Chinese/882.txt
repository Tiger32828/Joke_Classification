An American, a Korean, and a Taiwanese are exploring the jungle.
As a result, they were all captured by the cannibal tribe.
The tribal chief said, "I'm in a good mood today, I won't eat you, but you all have to get a hundred slaps! You can still say a wish before you get slapped!"

It was the Americans who got the plate first.
"Before hitting the board, put a cushion on my butt," he said.
When the pads are placed, the boards fall like raindrops;
Previously, 70 boards were okay, but after 70 boards, the cushion was smashed, and then the board saw blood...
After the spanking, the American touched his butt and left.

When the Koreans saw this, they asked for 10 mattresses.
1, 2, 3... After 100 beatings, the Korean got up, patted his butt, nothing.
Then he bragged about his ability to imitate and re-create with his stinky mouth open, and sat and watched the good show of the Taiwanese.


The Taiwanese slowly got down and said leisurely, "Come on, put the Koreans on me."
