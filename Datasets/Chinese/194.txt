In a computer class, a boy was talking to a girl next to him, but he was scolded by the teacher...
Teacher: "What to do?"
Boy: "I just asked him a question..."
Teacher: "If you have any questions, you should ask me!"
Boy: "Really?"
Teacher: "Yes! What's the problem?"
Boy: "Okay...are you free tonight?"
