Smart mothers know that self-esteem is a very valuable quality, so when Mary was a baby I used to ask her, "Why do I love you?"
She always replied, "Because I am Mary."
After her brother Gray learned to talk, I tried to ask him again, "Gray, why do I love you?"
He answered without hesitation, "Because I am Mary."
