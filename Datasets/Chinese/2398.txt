A friend got into the habit of going to prostitutes. He returned to Asia from America, only to be caught during the counterattack on the mainland.

Fortunately, he was not arrested or fined. The mainland officials only printed the word "prostitution" on his passport as a warning.

But he thought it was too ugly. He'd rather go to jail than run around with a passport with worms printed on it.

So he took a sum of money to the upper class. The top said, okay. So he took back his passport to amend it.

When he took his passport back, he almost vomited blood, because there was an extra word on it, which became: non-prostitute.

He thought, fuck, I might as well not spend the money! But he was still not reconciled, so he took another sum of money to the upper management.

After the upper layer touched his chin, he reluctantly said, "Okay. So he took back his passport.

When he got his passport back this time, he had given up hope in life.

This time, there are two more words on the passport. From non-sexual bugs to: African horny bugs.
