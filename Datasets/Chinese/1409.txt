A wife came to the hospital for help from a doctor.
The doctor asked her, "What's wrong with you?"
The lady replied, "I'm fine, it's my daughter. After my daughter is in love, she doesn't wear glasses anymore."
The doctor interrupted her and said, "If you don't wear glasses for short-sightedness, there won't be as serious consequences as you think."
The lady said anxiously: "Who says it's not serious? She is so short-sighted that she can't tell the difference. Recently, she went out to play with a boy. After she came back, the boy who brought her home was not the one who went out with her at first. that."
