When I was in the fifth grade of elementary school, the school held a science camp, and a male teacher who accompanied him was blowing his nose all the way, afraid that there would not be enough toilet paper.
Just as his brain was breaking down, the male teacher saw two vending machines outside the bathroom door in front.
In addition to being happy, the teacher proudly put ten yuan into the vending machine, and turned the button... "Bang", the thing fell!
But I saw the dazed look on the teacher's face, because it turned out to be a sanitary napkin!
The students on the side all laughed and bent over, and the teacher's "bad" expression can be imagined...
