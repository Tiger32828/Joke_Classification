The husband and wife agreed to call "going to bed" as "classing".
One day, the wife texted her husband: "Class tonight."
The husband wrote back: "There are entertainment, change to self-study!" The wife is not happy.
The next day, the husband said he was going to class, and the wife replied, "No need, I asked for a tutor last night!"
