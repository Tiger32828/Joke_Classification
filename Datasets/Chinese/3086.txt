The landlady found a homeless man sleeping on a park bench.
She kindly offered him the best room in her hotel.
The next morning, the homeless came to her to thank her and said he would rather go back to the park bench.
She said, "Why? Isn't it better here?"
He replied, "I appreciate your kindness. But when I slept on the bench, I often dreamed that I was sleeping on the warm and soft bed; but last night, I dreamed that I was still sleeping on the cold bench, and I was very uncomfortable. now!"
