There is an interesting story in the teahouse that the wealth of a high-ranking government official was deceived by several robbers.
In the morning, as soon as Lao Jiu arrived on the street, he heard a ten-year-old newsboy shouting:
"Selling newspapers, selling newspapers! An astonishing large-scale fraud case, the number of deceived persons has reached 20,820..."
Lao Jiu thought about whether there was any new activity, so he hurried over to buy a newspaper,
After turning around and leaving, I heard the newspaper director shouting again behind him:
"Selling newspapers, selling newspapers! An astonishing large-scale fraud case, the number of deceived persons has reached 20,830!"
