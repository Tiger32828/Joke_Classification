One day Xiao Ming came to his future mother-in-law's house as a guest.
Mother-in-law: "Just sit and sit, and the dishes will be ready in no time!"
Then, he went into the kitchen and got busy. At this time, only the nervous Xiao Ming and the dog Xiaobai raised by his mother-in-law were left in the living room.
Suddenly, Xiao Ming found that his stomach was hurting sharply, and he thought, "No way! I have to hold back!"
But he couldn't bear it anymore, poof! He let out an invincible smelly fart!
He thought to himself, "It's dead now, I'll be kicked out!"
Unexpectedly, the mother-in-law just shouted: "Xiao Bai!"
Xiao Ming then thought at ease: "Fortunately, Xiao Bai is my scapegoat."
Then he couldn't help but let the second fart, and his mother-in-law still shouted: "Xiao Bai!"
When he farted for the third time, he saw his mother-in-law rushing out and yelling, "Xiao Bai! You have to wait until you are stinky to death before you run away, don't you!"
