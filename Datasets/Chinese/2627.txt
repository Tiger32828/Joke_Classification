One day, my daughter stayed after school to practice the recitation competition, and came home late at night.
As soon as he entered the house, his father sternly scolded, "Why did you come back so late?"
The daughter was tired and impatient and replied, "It's reciting!"
Who knew that my father was even more angry when he heard it: "People are cool (Taiwanese)? What are you doing?"
