Jack Ma was recently upset because of something, so he went to see a well-respected Zen master.
The Zen master was silent, and meaningfully took out a hot water bottle and poured hot water into it.
Ma Yun said thoughtfully: Does the Zen master mean that this difficulty will be self-defeating like a hot water bottle? Or... I shouldn't inflate myself? "
The Zen master shook his head and said, "Neither! I just want you to know... I bought it on Taobao.com."
