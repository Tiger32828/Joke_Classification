The doctor prepared a toy train and locked 15 patients in the room, telling them that as long as they got on the toy train, they could go home, and 14 of the patients happily rode on the train and circled the room. , but one patient stood still and remained unmoved.

The attending physician was very happy to see it, and when he was about to walk over to praise him, he heard him cursing: "Look at these idiots, they are doing such stupid things~"
"Oh! You know they're doing stupid things?" the doctor asked happily
"Yeah! I haven't even gotten on the bus yet! Where are these idiots trying to drive the train?"
