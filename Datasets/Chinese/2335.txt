I passed a fitness video to my friend saying that if you follow it, you can lose weight quickly,
he believed me,
As a result, I gained more than ten pounds after a month.
He called and said I lied
I say you fool,
Those clips of eating pizza and hamburgers in the opening sequence are broad, and you don't have to follow them.
