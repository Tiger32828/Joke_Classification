One day, an inspector came to a national elementary school. Since the inspector focused on natural subjects, he wanted to know the level of this national elementary school.
He entered the self-study classroom and saw the globe.
So he asked the kid next to him, "My kid, do you know why the globe is tilted by 23.5 degrees?"
The kid shook his head in fear and said, "I didn't do it, I didn't do it..." and ran away...

The inspector was disappointed.
He decided to ask another child who looked smarter, and another child just happened to come in.
He asked, "Children, do you know why the globe is tilted 23.5 degrees?"
The child said, "I don't know.... I just came in..." and then ran away...

The inspector thought that the education in this school was too bad and wanted to talk to the teacher, so he told the teacher about it.
The teacher actually said, "Don't blame them too much. This globe was bought just like that. Who knows who broke it?"
Later, when the principal came in, he saw the inspector's face was not very good. After asking the reason, he said to the inspector, "I'm sorry, because the school's funds are insufficient, so I bought this kind of defective product."
