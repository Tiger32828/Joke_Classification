One day I went to McDonald's, there were a lot of people and the clerks were in a hurry
I hear the following conversation
The lady at the counter: "Hello, what would you like?"
Customer: "I want a children's meal"
The lady at the counter: "Okay, do you want to be happy with your children's meal?"
customer:"..........................................."
At this time, the lady at the counter realized that she had made a mistake.
So I quickly said, "I'm sorry, is your Coke a drink?"
Customer: "...................... er....yes, I want Coke"
Other customers and shop assistants: ".........................."
