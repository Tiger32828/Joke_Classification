Gui Sheng was invited to a grand tea party. The owner saw him sitting in a corner and hurriedly greeted him: "Gui Sheng, eat more!"
"Thank you for your kindness, I'm full." Gui Sheng replied politely.
Host: "Then, take some biscuits and vegetables and take them home!"
Gui Sheng: "I'm so sorry, my bag is already full and I can't put it any more."
