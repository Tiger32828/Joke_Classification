When a woman applied for a job, her boss asked, "How many children do you have?" She replied, "Ten."
The boss asked, "Then what are their names?"
She replied, "Xiaoming, Xiaoming, Xiaoming, Xiaoming, Xiaoming, Xiaoming, Xiaoming, Xiaoming, Xiaoming, Xiaoming."
The boss asked, "It's all called Xiaoming, so what do you do when you want to ask them to eat?"
"It's very simple," she said. "As long as my name is Xiaoming, they will come."
The boss asked again, "But what if you only want to call a certain child?"
"That's easier, I just call him by his last name," she said.
