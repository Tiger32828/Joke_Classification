One day, when Xiao Ming came to school, the teacher found that a large piece of sleep had fallen on his face and asked him, "What's the matter with you, Xiao Ming?"
Xiao Ming replied, "Yesterday, I didn't dare to sleep alone, so I ran to sleep with my parents and slept, and my father asked me if I fell asleep. I said not yet. After a while, my father asked me again if I fell asleep. No, I said not yet. As a result, Dad was very angry and punched me in the eye and said, "Why don't you sleep?"
After listening to the teacher, the teacher had a general understanding of what was going on, and the teacher said to Xiao Ming, "Mom and Dad may have some things to do at night. The teacher teaches you: If Dad asks you if you are asleep again, don't answer, just pretend Asleep, that's fine."
The next day Xiaohua came to school, but this time he became two "black wheel" teachers and asked Xiao Ming, "Xiao Ming~ Didn't you use the method taught by the teacher?"
Xiao Ming said, "Yes, when my father asked me, I didn't say anything."
Teacher: "Then why are you still being repaired by your father?"
Xiao Ming: "Yesterday I felt the bed shake for a while, and then I heard my dad say, "I'm going, I'm going, and then my mother said, "I'm going, I'm going too."
I jumped up excitedly and said, "Where you are going, I am going too"
Teacher: Enough~................................
