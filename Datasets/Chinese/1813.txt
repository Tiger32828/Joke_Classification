One day his son's beloved Transformers disappeared, and the whole family almost mobilized to find him.
The husband couldn't find it, so he asked his son to think about it: "You think about it, where was the last time you put the toy? Maybe there are some clues you can find."
I saw my son crying and saying, "The pigs, lions, horses, and chickens are all in the zoo. I don't need to look for them. I just want my Transformers!"
