A man was fishing on the shore, sitting leaning against a tree, very leisurely, even the float on the fishing rod moved, and he turned a blind eye.
The bystander couldn't help but tell him, "Hey, the fish has been hooked!"
The man didn't lift his eyelids and said, "Please take down the fish for me, put on the bait, and throw it down."
"A lazy person like you should have a son to help you," said the passerby.
"You're right," the man agreed, "but where am I going to find a pregnant woman to marry me?"
