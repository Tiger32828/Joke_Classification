The father asked his son to go to the post office to send a letter. After the son left, the father remembered that he forgot to write the address on the envelope.
When the son came back, the father hurriedly asked, "Didn't you notice that the letter was not addressed? Did you put it in the mailbox?"
"Already voted. I didn't write the address, but I found it long ago."
