One day, Xiao Ming went out to buy a black wheel at 7-11, but there was a red line next to the 7-11 and the car could not be stopped.
Unexpectedly, as soon as Xiao Ming walked out of 7-11, he saw a damn police officer opening a red ticket for illegal parking.
Xiao Ming's boss was upset and said, "Mr. Police, the prosperity is not very good~~ Don't be so strict~~"
However, the police ignored Xiao Ming and continued to write his red slip.
Xiao Ming said again: "Don't be so extreme, can't the car be driven right away?"
The policeman gave him a cold look and snorted.
Xiao Ming was even more unhappy and said, "Damn, don't think that students are easy to bully? Be careful I will complain to you!"
The police immediately opened another list of obstructing the execution of official duties!
At this time, Xiao Ming felt that he was about to lose face, so he had to continue to deal with him for 20 minutes, and said to him, "You have to punish more!"
As a result, a total of five tickets were issued: one for illegal parking, two for obstructing official duties, one without a license, and one without a driver's license. The police also towed the motorcycle away.
At this time, Abo, who was selling pancakes next to him, sighed and said, "Young man ㄟ~ why are you so impulsive~ I have opened several sheets ㄟ~ I think you are fined and punished as pants!"
The passers-by also nodded in agreement...
Xiao Ming had no choice but to tell Arbor, "Oh, it doesn't matter, that's not my car, my motorcycle is parked opposite! I just see the road injustice and act bravely."
