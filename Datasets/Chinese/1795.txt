Once in class, a classmate sitting at the back of the classroom was very hungry, so he made noodles directly behind him. In order not to let the teacher find out, he stood up to block the book, but white smoke still came out. The teacher found it and was very calm. said: "Which classmate was reading a book and saw that he had gone crazy?"
