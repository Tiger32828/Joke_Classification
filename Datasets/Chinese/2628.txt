The grandmother asked her good grandson what he was studying at school today, and the grandson replied, "The teacher teaches sex education today."
When the old man heard it, he said, "Yao Shou, you dare to teach children even this?"
After hearing this, my mother advised her mother-in-law: "Now you have to be a little more open-minded. This is part of the school curriculum."
After listening to it, the old man thought: "Oh, so this is homework."
When it was dinner time, the grandmother called her grandson for dinner and opened the door, only to find that the grandson was lying on the bed "masturbating"...
So she pretended to be enlightened and said, "My dear grandson, come to dinner after finishing your 'homework'. "
