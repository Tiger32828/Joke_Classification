There was a boy who didn't stutter, but spoke very slowly. One day the rain stopped, the boy's father took him to the hillside to pick bamboo shoots, and came to a steep hillside.
The boy's father was concentrating on picking bamboo shoots when a stone suddenly fell down. The boy said, "Dad~Yes~ (Alas! Father screams!)~Stone~Head~!"
Father: "Why are you talking so slowly at this time! Fortunately, it was just wiped!" The father thought to himself that it would be okay if such a thing happened again in the future, so he trained the boy to say, "Dad! There are rocks!" At least this is the case. Said to be able to respond faster.
One day, according to my usual habit, I asked the boy to say it before going out. The boy said, "Dad! There are rocks!"
Father: "Yeah! Not bad! That's good." This time, he came to the place where the accident happened last time.
Unfortunately, another stone rolled down, and the boy said, "Dad! There is a stone! (Father jumps away alertly)! There are~ (Alas!) Two~ stones~
