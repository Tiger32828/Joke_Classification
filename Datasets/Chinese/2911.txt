A couple of young men and women walked out after receiving the marriage certificate from the marriage registration office, talking while walking.
The man said triumphantly, "Honey, you are beautiful! But out of conscience, I have to tell the truth now.
I borrowed the mahogany furniture and the full set of furnishings that you saw at my house last time. "
The woman said, "It's okay. I'll tell you the truth. My sister's name was written on the marriage certificate just now."
The man was taken aback: "Your sister? Is that the annoying ugly one I saw last time at your house?"
Woman: "Don't call her that, she's your wife now."
