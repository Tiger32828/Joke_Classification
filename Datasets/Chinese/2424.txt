The husband and wife were watching a movie at home, and the wife said to her husband, "Remember when you took me to the cinema to see this movie? That was the first time you took me to see a movie."
Husband: "Isn't it just watching a movie? If you like me, I will take you there often."
His wife said: "Actually, what I like is the atmosphere of the movie theater. I remember that day, when you touched my chest and my thighs, it was very exciting."
Husband was stunned: "I don't have it! Fuck me!"
