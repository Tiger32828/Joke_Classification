In other words, a Frenchman and a German came to Taiwan, and they were invited to a restaurant for dinner; during the banquet,
The French first ate a big mouthful of "Kung Pao Chicken", but accidentally, they ate chili, which was very spicy, so the French shed tears while eating.
The German asked with concern: "What's the matter with you?"
The French said: "It's nothing! I just suddenly think of my mother and feel a little sad!"
Later, the Germans also ate a big mouthful of "Kung Pao Chicken", and when they ate the chili, they burst into tears.
At this time, the French also asked with concern: "What's the matter with you?"
The German replied: "It's nothing, I think of your mother too!"
When the Frenchman heard this, he felt very strange and asked, "You are crying. Do you also think of my mother?"
The German said: "I just think of your mother, how did you give birth to such a dishonest son?"
