A young man went to ask the great philosopher Socrates for lectures.
In order to show that he has a good eloquence, he talked a lot.
In the end, Socrates asked him to pay double the tuition.
The young man asked in amazement, "Why should I double it?"
Socrates smiled and said, "Because I have to teach you two lessons, one is how to shut up, and the other is how to speak."
