There is a man who always thinks he has no luck with women,
So I went to church to pray: "Please God give me a group of women by my side."
But unfortunately, just after he walked out of the church, he was hit by a car and was admitted to the hospital.
Lying in the hospital bed, he thought, "Why is God so unfair..."
Just thinking of this, the head nurse suddenly brought 20 beautiful trainee girls to his bed and said to them:
"This patient is immobilized due to a traffic accident, you first need to teach him how to use the potty."
