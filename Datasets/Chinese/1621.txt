One day a pair of very close friends were drinking together.
Mr. A suddenly said to Mr. B, "Hey. Didn't your wife let you drink?"
Mr. B replied: "I am like a tiger running in the desert at home. I will be afraid of her! Haha"
Soon his wife came back from shopping!
Mr. B suddenly shouted: "Quick. Wu Song is back! Help me clean up the table."
