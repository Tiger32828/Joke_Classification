An old lady in shabby clothes went to the supermarket and bought three cans of canned cat food.
When I was going to pay the bill, the cashier said, "Old lady, you have to bring the cat. Make sure you have a cat before I can sell it to you. Some poor old people eat canned cats!"
The old lady had no choice, so she brought the cat to the checkout lady.

The next day, the old lady went to the supermarket to buy three cans of canned dog food.
When I was going to pay the bill, the cashier said, "Old lady, you have to bring the dog. Make sure you have a dog before I can sell it to you. Some poor old people eat canned dog food!"
The old lady had no choice, so she brought the dog to the checkout lady.

The next day, the old lady simply took a cardboard box and went to the supermarket.
Holding the box, she walked slowly to the cashier and asked her to put her finger in and feel it.
The cashier said terrified, "What is this? Isn't it a snake?"
After the old lady repeatedly assured her that the contents of the box would never hurt her, the cashier finally reached in and touched it, and then extended it out.
The cashier smelled: "Evil...how does it smell...like poop?"

Old lady: "Yes - can I buy three rolls of toilet paper now?"
