The town lady visits the farm for the first time.
"My God!" she said, pointing to an animal. "Why doesn't that cow have horns?"
The farmer explained solemnly: "There are many reasons why cows don't have horns, some were accidentally broken, some were sawed off by us, and some special species were born without horns... However, this cow has no horns, there is only one reason: it It's a horse."
