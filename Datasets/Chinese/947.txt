There was a man who was blind in one eye, a man with a broken leg, and a man with a pockmarked face
Three people are deadlocked over a piece of meat
So someone suggested that the game be decided, how to play? Everyone first describes themselves in one sentence, and whoever describes them best will eat the meat.
The one with one leg spoke first: "I am independent and independent."
The one-eyed blind man went on to say, "I have a unique eye, and I can see at a glance."
When it was Mazi's turn, he didn't say a word. He grabbed the piece of meat and stuffed it into his mouth, eating it. The other two protested in unison!
Mazi said while eating, "Because I'm shameless!"
