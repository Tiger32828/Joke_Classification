One day, my mother said to me, "Son, don't stay at home all day, go out and make girlfriends~"
I said, "Mom, I know that too, but... no one likes me!"
Mom: "Oh~ There are so many women in the world, someone must like you~ If a girl likes you, what are you willing to do for him?"
Me: "I would do anything for her!"
Mom: "My good son~ Mom likes you~"

"Go do the laundry, wash the dishes, mop the floor...clean up!!"
