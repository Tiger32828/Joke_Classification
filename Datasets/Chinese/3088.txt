At night in a certain village, many people gather there to chat, talk about world affairs and talk about the world.
When talking about a certain person, a person B said that this person has a very high moral character and is also very kind, but it is a pity that there is also a downside!
"What's the downside?" someone asked.
B also said, "Although A is a good person, he has a short temper and is very reckless!"
Just then, A passed by here. Hearing someone criticize him like this, he rushed through the door and said furiously, "When did I get irritable?" So he raised his hand and hit B.
The other person said, "How can you hit someone?"
"Why can't I, he said I'm grumpy and reckless, when am I irritable and reckless? What do you think?"
The crowd said, "You're not being irritable when you lose your temper now, and you're not being reckless when you raise your hand to hit someone?"
