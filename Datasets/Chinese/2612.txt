There is a pair of lovers who are in a relationship in the past month, and suddenly the girl wants to fart, but she is afraid of the bad scenery, so she has a plan.
She asked her boyfriend, "I can learn the sound of pigeons, do you want to hear it?"
The boyfriend said, "Wow!" So she learned to "goo-goo" loudly, and at the same time took the opportunity to let her fart go.
The girl asked, "How, do I study like it?"
Boyfriend: "The fart is so loud that I can't hear it clearly."
