After the dictator Adolf Hitler came to power, a citizen went to the police station to request a name change.
The policeman said, "Sir, under normal circumstances, we are not allowed to change your name. Maybe you have some special reason, can you tell me what your name is?"
"Adolf Stinkfoot."
"Yes, the question is very clear, this name needs to be changed. So, what do you want to change to?"
"Mortz Stinkfoot."
