Lao Zhang has a parrot, he speaks Mandarin and Taiwanese, Lao Zhang lives on the second floor of the apartment, and the downstairs floor is a gas bank, every time when there is no gas, Lao Zhang shouts downstairs: "(Taiwanese) ), come in a barrel of gas.” Over time, the parrot learned, once when Lao Zhang was on a business trip for five days, the parrot had nothing to do at home, so he imitated Lao Zhang and called downstairs: “Come in a barrel of gas”, The workers downstairs carried the gas to Lao Zhang's house. After five days, when Lao Zhang returned from a business trip, he opened the door and saw that the house was full of gas buckets. Lao Zhang was very angry. The parrot's wings were spread out and nailed to the wall in the shape of a cross. The parrot turned his head and saw the statue of Jesus nailed to the cross beside him. He asked Jesus, "(Taiwanese) Hey! Are you calling for a few barrels of gas? It was also nailed to the wall.”
