A story has recently circulated in Poland: Cohen, a long-standing Communist Party member, is applying to immigrate to a foreign country.
The passport office officer was shocked and summoned Cohen to ask, "There must be a very unusual reason for a loyal party member like you to leave this beautiful country."
"There are two reasons," Cohen said. "The neighbor said to me last night:
"Cohen, when this government collapses, all Communists will be hanged, and neither you nor I will be spared. „Äè
So I don't want to wait until that day. I am going abroad. "
The official said with a smile: "Cohen, I can guarantee this government will not collapse."
"Ah," Cohn said, "that's my second reason."
