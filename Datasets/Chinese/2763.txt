Xiao Li and Xiao Zhang are in love. Xiao Li's father stipulated that Xiao Li must go home before ten o'clock in the evening.
One night, when Xiao Li and Xiao Zhang were talking about their love, they forgot the time.
When the two rushed to the door of Xiao Li's house and kissed goodbye, the light at the door was on.
Xiao Li's father stuck his head out: "I can forgive you for coming back late, and I forgive you for daring to kiss my daughter in front of me, but please don't lean on the doorbell, okay?"
