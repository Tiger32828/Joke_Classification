I said to my mother, "Mom, I want to have a dog."
My mother gave me a look and ignored me and continued watching TV.
In the spirit of the 11th revolution of the founding father, I continued to bombard my mother's spirit and kept repeating: "I want to raise a dog...I want to raise a dog..."
My mother couldn't take it anymore, she said yes: "I promise to let you have a dog"
However, if you can't let it step on the floor of the house, I will let you have a dog.
As soon as I heard it, I was dumbfounded and couldn't step on the floor. Could it be that the puppy would go head-to-head?

I told my classmates about this.
My classmate said, "What's this! I told my mother that I want to have a dog, and my mother thought about it for a long time... Only one sentence was said, there can only be one animal in the family, you decide for yourself whether you want to keep it. one."
