One day, when I went out to play with my classmates, we were chatting and eating.
There was a child at the next table crying desperately and we couldn't stand it.
So the "chaste girl" among the classmates walked gently and slowly to the side of the child.
"Didi, come over here, okay? Big sister has something to tell you!"
So the child walked over while crying.
The harsh girl smiled and told him, "Didi~ tell you~ If you cry again... I'll break your neck! Then flush down the toilet~"
So the child stopped crying.
Hehe...it's very useful~ Just as everyone was laughing, a child suddenly came over.
"Sister....don't force me to go home and take the plane..and land on your chest~"
