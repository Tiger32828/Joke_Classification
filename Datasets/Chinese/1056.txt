Ah Yue bought a new carpet one day and spread it on the living room floor. The furry felt very comfortable. Ah Yue's five-year-old daughter, Xiangxiang, liked to lie on the carpet when she had nothing to do.

Ayue: "Xiangxiang, why are you lying on the carpet again?"
Xiangxiang: "Alas! I didn't mean to, I just tripped over by an ant!"
Ayue: "..."
