College student: Mom! I met Nobita today and it shocked me!
Mother: Which one is Nobita?
College students: Nobita in high school! The two of us were in the same class at that time, and he and I both wanted to go to medical school at that time!
Mother: But didn't that person commit suicide after failing the exam a few times?
College students: Yes! The corpse I dissected today is him!
