A man asked the seamen: "I heard that your father and grandfather died on the ship because of the shipwreck. Is it true?"
"it is true!"
"That's why you like to take a boat!"
The sea-seeker asked the man, "Do you also have a bed at home?"
"yes!"
"You like the bed too! Then, did your father and grandfather also die in the bed?"
