A poet exclaimed: "Why don't poets call themselves 'home' like novelists and essayists?"
A person next to him explained: "Poets are very romantic. They have to go everywhere to find inspiration and cannot be dragged down by 'home'."
"No!" The poet said helplessly: "Because a poem can't be sold for a few dollars, we are unable to become a 'home'!"
