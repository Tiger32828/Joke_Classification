Two misers, A and B, are good friends. Today is A's birthday, B took an egg to celebrate A's birthday,
Said, "My brother's birthday, I'll give you a fat chicken, but it's just a little tender." A didn't say anything and accepted it.
Soon, on B's birthday, A chopped down a few new bamboos, carried them to B to celebrate his birthday, and said, "On the birthday of my virtuous brother, I sent ten catties of fresh bamboo shoots, but I'm a little older."
