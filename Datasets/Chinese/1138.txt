A doctor drove home, passed through a lunatic asylum, and suddenly had a flat tire.
The doctor hurriedly got out of the car to change the tires. In a hurry, he accidentally dropped four screws into the gap of the gutter cover beside the car.
The doctor tried his best, but still couldn't pick up the screw, he was sweating profusely, and he didn't know what to do...
At this time, the "patient" who had been watching for a long time also followed the discussion...
One of them said to the doctor: You first remove a screw from each of the other three tires, and then drive to the garage!
The doctor had an epiphany, and did as the "patient" said, and sure enough, the car was able to start again after a while...
At this time, the doctor asked the clever "patient" gratefully and suspiciously:
"Hey, you are so smart, why are you staying in a nursing home?"
"Patient" said, "I'm a lunatic, not a fool!"
The doctor was ashamed, but thanked the "patient"
Said: "Then wish your illness a speedy recovery!"
At this time, the "patient" said sincerely to the doctor:
"My disease will be cured. But your stupidity will not heal..."
