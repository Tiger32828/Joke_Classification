Here's how a young man wooed a girl who worked as a teller in the bank's deposit department:
"Miss, I've been saving this idea, hoping to get interest.
If you're free on Saturday, can you deposit yourself into the seat next to me in the movie theater?
I'm a little concerned that you may have a promissory note booked for another appointment. If so, I'll take out my invitation and set it up for Sunday.
Regardless of the ROI, it is a pleasure to be your company. I don't think you'd think that's too much of a request! "
