A is late for oversleeping
When I entered the classroom, I found that the teacher hadn't come to class yet.
But the location is only the back corner of the classroom = =
Helpless, the teacher said before that this class will ask for names.
A had to squeeze slowly towards the corner...
There was a female classmate sitting in front of the vacant seat in the corner,
But it happened to be lying on the table to sleep, and I couldn't get through without shaking it up.
A had to shake the female classmate awake,
Say to her, "Can you stand up? I'm going in behind you..."
