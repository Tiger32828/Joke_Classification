Students will be called underline, and students will follow the action at this time.
But one student was very serious. When the English teacher said this sentence was very important and underline it,
The student nodded in agreement.
Time passed by, and the university entrance exam was almost approaching. One day the teacher said:

Zhang replied: What is the teacher's underline?
