One day, a friend called me and asked me: How do you say skirts in Taiwanese?
I said: go away!
He asked again: How do you say skirts in Taiwanese?
I said: Go away!
Then he ignored me.

Another day, a friend called me and asked me: How do you say taro in Taiwanese?
I said: oh.
He asked again: I asked you how to say taro in Taiwanese?
I said: oh ah.
Then he hung up again.

Another day, he called me again and asked me: How do you say duck in Taiwanese?
I said: ah!
He repeated the question: How do you say duck in Taiwanese?
I said: ah!
He hung up the phone with a long "ah".

Another day, my friend called again and asked: How do you say serve in Taiwanese?
I said: fuck you.
Later, friends stopped calling me!
I'm telling the truth, that's how Taiwanese is pronounced!
