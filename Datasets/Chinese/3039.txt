Someone asked Mark Twain what was the difference between a small mistake and a big mistake.
He replied, "If you come out of a restaurant and leave your umbrella there and take someone else's umbrella, that's a small mistake. But if you take someone else's umbrella, you take your own umbrella too. It's a big mistake to leave."
