Zhang replied, "I'm here for a blood test."
Xiao Wang asked again, "So what? Why are you crying? Are you afraid?"
Xiao Zhang replied, "No, it's just during the inspection that they cut my finger, it hurts!"
After Xiao Wang heard this, he began to cry loudlyâ€”
Xiao Zhang asked him in surprise, "Why are you crying?"
Xiao Wang replied, "I'm here for a urine test, I'm afraid they'll cut my...head-"
