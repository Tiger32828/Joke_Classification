A lady went to a fortune teller to tell her fortune, and after the fortune teller looked at her,

He said to her, "Miss, I'm afraid you have to be careful recently! Because you have a 'bad omen' on you!"

After listening to that, the lady thought about it and said, "Then after I take off the 'bra', will it improve a little?"
