Both China and Egypt are ancient civilizations. Both Chinese and Egyptians are proud of their country's long civilization.
One day, a Chinese chatted with an Egyptian.
The Egyptian proudly said, "Did you know that last year, the Egyptian National Archaeological Team carried out a large-scale excavation under the pyramids and discovered cables. It can be seen that there were telephones for communication in ancient Egypt."
The Chinese said: "A few months ago, our national archaeological team carried out a large-scale excavation on the Great Wall, but nothing was found. It shows that there was radio in ancient China!"
