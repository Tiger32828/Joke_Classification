One day a female customer ordered a cup of oolong green
The boss asked her: ice cubes? ?
Female customer said: normal
The boss asked again: what about the sweetness?
The woman put her finger on her face and said: As sweet as me~~

Then the boss silently turned his head and shouted to the person behind: "One cup of Oolong Green without sugar"
