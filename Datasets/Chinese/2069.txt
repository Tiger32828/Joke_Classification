Feng and Xiaoyu had a big quarrel today, Xiaoyu said with snot and tears, "If I had known, I would have listened to my mother, don't marry you!"
Feng was stunned for a moment, then asked slowly, "You mean... your mother stopped you from marrying me?"
Xiaoyu nodded, Xiaofeng thumped the table hard and said, "Ah! I've really blamed her all these years!"
