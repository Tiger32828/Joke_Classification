A braggart from Texas, USA, taking a taxi around London.
"What building is this?" the Texan asked.
"Sir, that's the Tower of London," the taxi driver replied.
"I'm telling you, we could have a building like this in two weeks," the Texan said in a drawn out voice.
After a while he asked again, "What building did we just pass by?"
"Sir, that's Buckingham Palace, where the Queen lives."
"Really?" said the Texan. "You know a palace like this in ours can be built in a week."
A few minutes later, they passed Westminster Abbey again. At this time, the Texan asked again, "Hey, driver, what building is that over there?"
"Sir, I'm afraid I don't know either," the driver said with a smile. "Yesterday morning, I didn't see it when I passed by!"
