It is said that a certain lady bought a female parrot on a whim.
Unexpectedly, when I brought it home, the first sentence it said was: "Want to sleep with me?"
When the lady heard this, she thought to herself, "Damn it, outsiders think I taught these words, doesn't this ruin my ladylike image?" !

So she tried her best to teach the parrot to say something elegant, but the female parrot was so determined that she would only say one sentence: "Want to have sex with me?"
How to do it? When the lady was at a loss, she heard that the priest also kept a parrot (male), and that parrot, not only did not speak foul language, but was a devout believer who prayed most of the day. So the lady hurried to the priest for help.

After the priest understood her intention, he said with an embarrassed expression, "This is very difficult to handle. In fact, I didn't teach it anything to that parrot. The reason why it is so religious may be that it has been cultivated here for a long time. Because of it."

Seeing that the lady was disappointed, the priest said, "Well, you can bring that parrot to me, and I will put them together. I hope that after a while, your parrot can be converted. I can only do it. In this way, whether there is any effect or not depends on the will of God…”

As soon as the lady heard it, that was all she could do. Isn't there a saying: "Jianzhu Zhechi?" Give it a try. So she took the parrot to the priest. The priest put the two parrots together as promised.

At first, the female parrot was a little cautious. Seeing the male parrot in the corner of the cage, praying silently, she really couldn't bear to be disturbed.
But she still couldn't stand herself, and finally said aloud, "Want to sleep with me?"
When the male parrot heard this, he stopped praying and turned to look at the female parrot.
Suddenly tears poured down: "Thank God, my wish after so many years of prayer has finally come true..."
