The stubborn professor is not used to the young people's concept of love nowadays,
Speaking in class:
"It was recently reported that 90% of adult women in our country are not virgins.
Mr. President is inconceivable to this fact,
So send letters to the other 10% of women who remain virgins.
Ladies and gentlemen, do you know what was written in the President's letter? "
Everyone shook their heads and said they didn't know.
The professor said, "Really you don't know?"
The professor said, "Then you haven't received any letters."
