Three people died and entered the kingdom of heaven. When they arrived, St. Peter asked the first man if he had been faithful to his wife while he was alive.
The man admitted to doing two things wrong. St. Peter said he could only get a small sedan.
Then St. Peter asks the second man if he is faithful to his wife, and the second man confesses that he has done something wrong.
St. Peter said he could get a midsize sedan. The third told St. Peter that he remained faithful to his wife until his death.
St. Peter then presented him with a limousine.
A week later, the three of them were out in their car when they hit a red light and they all stopped.
Two people sitting in a small car and a mid-size car saw the person in the luxury car crying,
So he asked him, "Why are you crying when you have such a nice car?" The man said, "I just saw my wife and she only rides a bicycle."
