A physicist, mathematician and chemist go to the beach together...
The physicist said, "I want to study the regularity of the motion of the ocean." So he ran into the sea,
The mathematician said, "I want to study the curve of the ocean waves when they ebb and flow." So he also ran into the sea,
But after a long time, neither of them came back, so the chemist took a pen and wrote:

"Physicists and mathematicians are soluble in water."
