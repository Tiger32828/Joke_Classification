A loving couple is celebrating their golden wedding day.
The middle-aged neighbor who was watching the excitement asked the old man, "Why can you maintain a happy and beautiful marriage for 50 years? Since I was born, I have never heard the sound of your quarrel. Haven't there been any disputes between you?"
The old man said: "Of course there are disputes, but they will not expand. I have known this since my honeymoon.
I remember that when the transportation was inconvenient, we went to the Grand Canyon for our honeymoon, and we hired a donkey by ourselves.
Her donkey is obviously lazy and rests on the side of the road after walking for a long time.
I only heard my wife say coldly: "First time. 』
When the donkey wanted to be lazy for the second time, she pointed at the donkey and said, "This is the second time. 』
When the donkey refused to go for the third time, she took out her revolver and killed it! "
The middle-aged neighbor, the old gentleman, said in surprise, "Mrs. Zun is so cruel!"
The old gentleman said, "Isn't it? I couldn't see it was not the one who stopped beside me to accuse her. She didn't argue with me but just said to me coldly: 'the first time'."
