One night, a thief came to Ah'Dai's house to steal something.
Ah'Dai looked at it, instead of shouting to catch the thief, he moved things for the thief.
The next day his father asked him, "Why do you carry things for the thief?"
Ah'Dai said, "Dad, don't you always say, 'Helping others is the foundation of happiness?'"
