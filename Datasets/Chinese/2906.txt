An old woman walked into the marriage agency and said to the staff:
"I feel so lonely! I have an inheritance and I have nothing but a husband. Can you introduce me to one?"
Staff: "What conditions are you looking for?"
Old woman: "He must be likable, educated, articulate, fond of sports, has a wide range of interests, and most importantly,
I want him to be at home with me all day long. When I want to talk to him, he opens his mouth; when I get bored, he doesn't say anything. "
"I understand, this lady." The staff member said after listening patiently, "What you need is a TV."
