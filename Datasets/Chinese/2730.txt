Wang Laowu has four children, all of whom are very naughty.
When I came home from work one day, the children were making a lot of noise at home. When the wife saw Wang Laowu coming back, she was very happy and said, "You are finally back, great."
Wang Laowu was very happy, thinking that the children were afraid of him, but his wife then said, "You are the only one in the family who listen to me, darling, go and buy a packet of salt!"
