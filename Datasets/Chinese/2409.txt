One day the teacher was in a history class and asked the classmates: ã„£ The students are thirty-five and famous, and the clouds and the moon are eight thousand miles away. Who said this? "
The whole class was silent and no one answered, and suddenly the monitor raised his hand: "Teacher, I know that is what Yue Fei said."
The teacher said, "This class leader is too powerful. The teacher will give you five points!"

The teacher asked the second question again, "Who has never died in this life since ancient times, and who has left Danqing to illuminate the hearts of the Chinese, who said this?"
The whole class was quiet again, no one answered, and the monitor raised his hand again: "Teacher, I know, that's what Wen Tianxiang said."

Teacher: "If you answered correctly, the monitor will add 5 points. My classmates, the monitor has done a very good job. Now I will add 10 points. If you win, you will get 10 points more! You read the book first."

When the teacher turned around and wrote an article on the blackboard,
A male classmate was very upset, so he scolded the monitor: "If you are the monitor again, what else can you do?"
The teacher was very angry: "Who said that?"
At this time, the whole class was still quiet, and no one dared to admit it.
Suddenly the squad leader raised his hand again: "Teacher, I know, it was our President Chen who said that I have already become the president, otherwise what would you do?"
