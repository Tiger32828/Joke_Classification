On the weekend night, my father took Xiao Ming to the cello concert. Before leaving, my father was very worried that his naughty son would be restless and noisy after the performance started. He did not expect that Xiao Ming was very quiet after the whole concert and behaved very well. Clever.
After the performance, he walked out of the concert hall. Dad couldn't help but curiously asked Xiaoming: "Son, why are you so good tonight, you didn't harass Dad to go out, do you like today's cello performance?"
Xiao Ming said, "No, Dad, I'm just curious, when will the uncle on the stage be able to saw that big wooden box open?"
