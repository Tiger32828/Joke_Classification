How many hands and feet does an octopus have? We often say that octopuses have eight legs, but some people say that they have eight tentacles. So how many hands do octopuses have? How many feet?
There is a way to tell the difference: first catch an octopus, and then hit its head with a hammer, the octopus will touch its head with its hands, and the rest with its feet!
