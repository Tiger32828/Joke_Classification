Bought a bottle of coffee milk at a convenience store with a straw attached.
When I wanted to check out, the clerk was a foreigner and asked me, "Do you want a straw?"
After listening to it, I saw that there was already an attached straw on it and replied, "No need."
As a result, he tore off the straw from the packaging and threw it away.
