Whenever I mop the floor in the hallway, I like to think about something.
Once, when I was wandering around again, I suddenly felt that the mop became lighter?
I looked down - oh my god! When did the mop split in half?
I didn't even notice it at all, I was still holding a mop without a cloth, holding it all the time.......
Seeing the boys in the next class laughing together makes me really embarrassed!
