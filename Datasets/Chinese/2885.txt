There is a person who has been working abroad for many years and has not been in touch with his family for a long time.
In the middle of the night, the harsh phone ringing woke him up from his sweet dream. He picked up the phone impatiently,
It turned out to be a call from his mother, telling him that today was his birthday,
The son said angrily, "Did you call in the middle of the night just to tell me about this?"
The mother said gently to her son on the phone, "My son, you woke me up like this at this time thirty years ago."
