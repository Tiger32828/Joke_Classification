During the First World War, the military tried to persuade young people to join the army.
Invite a psychiatrist to make up a set of persuasion words:
"There are two possibilities for being a soldier:
One was left behind and the other was sent to the front.
Naturally, there is nothing to worry about for those who stay in the rear. There are two possibilities for those who are sent to the front line, one is injured and the other is not injured.
There's nothing to worry about if you're not injured,

There are two possibilities for injury:
One was slightly injured, the other was seriously injured. No need to worry about minor injuries.
There are only two possibilities for serious injury:
One is cured, the other is not cured. Of course you don't have to worry if it's cured, can it be cured...
Well, since he's already dead, what's there to worry about? "
