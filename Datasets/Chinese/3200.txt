I got my driver's license when I was 18. I was so proud that I wanted to be stopped by the police immediately so I could show off my license.
There is a busy intersection in town with police officers directing traffic throughout the day.
I approached the policeman again and again, braked abruptly, and spun hard to get his attention.
After so many times, he finally gestured to me to get on the sidewalk.
I was overjoyed and ready to pull out my driver's license.
But he leaned against the door and smiled and said, "Miss, I don't want to disappoint you, but I'm married."
