On the first day of school, Xiaohua went home from school,
I was very happy to tell my dad, "Dad, the teacher asked a question at school today, and I was the only one in the class who raised my hand to answer."
Dad was a little proud when he heard it, and thought, "This kid is as good as me."
So he asked, "What's the problem?"
"The teacher asked: 'Who didn't hand in the winter vacation homework?' I raised my hand and said, 'Me!'"
