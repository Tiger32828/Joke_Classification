One night, the only passengers on a certain bus were the driver and a very beautiful woman, and then a man came up.
The man wanted to talk to the beautiful woman, so he sat next to the woman and said, "Well, the air is so fragrant! Are you wearing the perfume?"
The woman ignored him, and the man said again: "This perfume is really fragrant, where did you buy it, miss, I want to buy it for my sister, please tell me?"
The woman said: "You still don't buy this brand of perfume for your sister, lest your sister will attract flies like you after she wipes it."
