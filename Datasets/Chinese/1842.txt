Once in class, the teacher suddenly saw a student
Right hand in plaster and bandage
The teacher asked, "Why haven't I seen you for a few days, what's wrong with your hand?"
Health: "Broken......"
Teacher: "Ah! How could it be broken?"
Sheng: "Because I'm too lazy, so I cut it off..."
Teacher: "What! If you're too lazy, your hand will break?"
Sheng: "No! Because I was walking on the road a few days ago, and a small rock ran into my shoe while I was walking. Because I was too lazy to take off the shoe and pour the stone, I held the telephone pole with my right hand. My left foot was shaking in mid-air, I wanted to shake the stone down, but a man suddenly ran behind me and broke my hand with a stick..."
Teacher: "Why?"
Sheng: "Alas...he thought I was electrocuted..."
