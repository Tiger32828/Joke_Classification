Recently, the manager, who often asks his subordinates to work overtime every night, asked his subordinates, "I'm sorry for making you leave work so late last night! Did your wife not complain?"
The subordinate replied, "It's nothing, but when I went out this morning, my wife said this to me..."
"What do you say?"
"Dear, are you still working overtime tonight?"
"Then how do you answer her?"
"I said: 'Hmm! Probably!'"
"What did she say?"
"My wife said: 'Then you must really work overtime! Don't come back too early!'"
