A Frenchman, an Englishman, and an American brag about how fast the trains in their own countries are.
The French said: "In my country, the train moves so fast that the telephone poles along the way are like garden fences."
"In my hometown, the train is so fast that we have to throw water on its wheels, or it will get white-hot," the Briton said.
"What's so great about that," said the American, "in my country, once I wanted to go on a trip, my daughter came up to the platform to see me off,
As soon as I got into the train car, the train started, and I leaned out the window to kiss my daughter, but I kissed a farmer in a field six miles away from my daughter. "
