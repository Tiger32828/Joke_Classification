In the largest post office in New York City on Monday morning, everyone is hard at work.

Suddenly, an employee in charge of handling undeliverable letters found a letter with no recipient address or zip code, just a few words in large letters: "Sincerely God." It was sent to the warehouse for storage, but the vigorous words attracted the employee, who, after discussing it with other employees, decided to open the letter.

The letter read: "Dear God, I came to New York from Puerto Rico a month ago, but I am very depressed. I can't find a job, I can't find friends, and I miss my family and friends back home. It's too big and too loud and I have a very strong sense of loss. God! If you can give me two hundred dollars to buy a plane ticket back to Puerto Rico, I can get my lost joy back and I will thank you forever Yes! Dear Fernandez

The post office workers decided to help the poor guy, and they rounded up a hundred and fifty dollars, which they thought was enough to buy an economy class ticket from New York to Puerto Rico. They sent the money to poor Fernandez according to the address in the letter.

Two months later, the same letter reappeared at the New York Post Office, still in large letters: "From God." They opened the envelope and it said, "Dear God, I'm back in Puerto Rico, everything is going well in my life now, I've got a good job, I'm with my family and friends. I've also met a Beautiful girl, we are getting married, thanks to your help, one day I will go and thank you in person. Dear Fernandez. One more thing I want to tell you, don't send any more money Give it to me, those fucking post office workers who stole fifty dollars."
