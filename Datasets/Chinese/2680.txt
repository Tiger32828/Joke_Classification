At a dinner in Berlin, a German woman was talking to a Russian general who was impressed by the meal and said that seeing it at a time when so many people in the city were hungry, it was even more heartwarming. She felt sad, which made the Russian general very uncomfortable.
"I really don't know about you Germans," he said. "You talk about food. We only talk about art in Russia."
To this, the woman replied, "Yes, but of course people talk about things they don't have."
