There is a couple who are very loving, having sex almost 30 days a month.​​
One day, my wife suddenly felt unwell, and the doctor said after the examination: You are suffering from neuropathic pain caused by excessive sex. You must stop having sex for three months, otherwise it may be life-threatening.​​
After returning, the wife told the husband about the matter, so the two had to endure it for three months and slept in separate rooms.​​
However, just a week later, the husband couldn't help but walked to his wife's room that night. He happened to see that his wife was going out of the room. The wife was surprised to see the husband and asked, "Is something wrong?"​​
The husband said seriously: "I'm here to kill you, what about you?"
The wife replied shyly, "I'm here to kill myself."
