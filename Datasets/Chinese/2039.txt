One day Deng Xiaoping and Li Peng visited the United States, and Clinton hosted a banquet for them.
The dining table was full of high-grade silver tableware. Li Peng stole a spoon and put it in his pocket when he saw that he was happy.
Only Deng Xiaoping saw this behavior. Deng Xiaoping also wanted to make it in the same way, but because of his old age, he accidentally touched the dinner plate when he was stealing the spoon, making a loud noise, and all eyes were focused on him.
At this time, Deng Xiaoping still calmly put the spoon in his pocket and said:
"Everyone, now I make a magic trick for everyone to see. I put this spoon in my pocket, and then I can conjure it out of someone else's pocket."
After speaking, Deng Xiaoping said to Li Peng, "Li Peng, take out the spoon in your pocket."
Immediately, the whole hall applauded, and only Li Peng was dumb to eat the yellow lotus.
