Ji Yun in the Qing Dynasty had a joke like this. After a day of worship,
An old eunuch walked with Ji Yun and others. The old eunuch asked Ji Yun to tell a joke.
Ji Yun thought for a moment and said, "There was a eunuch in the past." After that, he didn't say any more.
The old eunuch waited for a long time to hear Ji Yun speak, and then asked, "How's it going?"
Ji Yun replied, "It's long gone!" The people next to him couldn't stop laughing.
