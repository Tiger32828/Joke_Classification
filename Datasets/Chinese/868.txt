A "Lan Baoguini" was driving on the highway, and when he saw a TOYOTA VIOS 1500cc broke down and parked on the shoulder of the road, he kindly extended a helping hand.
Lamborghini: "I hooked the tow rope to your car, and then slowly towed it to a nearby depot. If you think the speed is too fast, you will 'flash your headlights' to remind me to slow down."

In this way, the Blue Paul Guini pulled the VIOS and drove slowly on the highway.
On the way, a "Ferrari" overtook Lamborghini and forced the car to challenge Lamborghini.
Lamborghini was on fire, and his horse raced with Ferrari.
The two "car owners" who had lost their minds did not notice the police with laser guns on the side of the road.

The police were startled when they saw the laser gun.
He picked up the walkie-talkie and reported to the colleague who set up the roadblock in front: "I really can't believe it! A Lamborghini and a Ferrari were racing at 280 kilometers per hour, and a VIOS was flashing its headlights behind to make them give way. . . ..."
