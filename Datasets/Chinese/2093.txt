One day, when I was driving on the road, I saw a woman whose car turned off and just stopped in the middle of the road. She was so nervous.
But the more nervous the woman is, the more the car doesn't move. At this moment, the woman got out of the car and walked towards the man who honked his horn, just when a hot scene was about to happen...
The lady said, "Sir, can you go over and start the car for me, and I'll honk the horn for you."
