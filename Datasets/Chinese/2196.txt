There is a member outside, he gave birth to three precious daughters together, and finally all three daughters are grown up and can be married. After discussing with his wife, he decided to marry them out on the same day, so he booked three adjacent rooms. bridal chambers for their daughters.
On the night of the wedding, after the wedding banquet, the staff sent away relatives and friends, and finally sent the daughters to the bridal chamber, but he and his wife decided to hide outside their door to eavesdrop because they were worried about their daughters' happiness.

When they tiptoed to the door of the eldest daughter, only to hear the eldest daughter laughing constantly, their hearts were relieved and they said in unison, "My daughter is happy! YA!"
But when they got to the door of the second daughter, they heard the second daughter crying constantly. Their mood suddenly sank to the bottom, and they thought to themselves: "Second daughter! Why are you so miserable!"
They walked heavily to the door of the third daughter, and they stood there for a long time, but there was no sound.

After tossing and turning all night, I finally waited until dawn and called all three of my daughters to inquire about what happened on the night of the bridal chamber yesterday.
The eldest daughter answered first: "I laughed! It was because I was so happy that I couldn't help but laugh."
The second daughter replied: "Sorry for worrying my parents! They were crying because they were "overjoyed"! That's why they cried."
The third daughter was very embarrassed, but "silent".
The waiter was in a hurry, so he raised his voice and asked, "What's going on?"
The third daughter had no choice but to reply: "My mother has repeatedly warned me that you can't speak with something in your mouth."
