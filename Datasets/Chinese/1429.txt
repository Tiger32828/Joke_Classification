Women A and B were chatting, and A said, "You have to use your means in front of your husband. Once, a friend of his came to drink at home. I deliberately wore a short skirt instead of underwear, and squatted down to pick up things. When he saw me, he asked me why, and I said I don’t even have money to buy underwear, he understood my suggestion and gave me five thousand yuan!”
Woman B also decided to follow suit and did the same on the same occasion. Her husband really brought her into the room. She said that she had no money to buy underwear, but her husband only gave her ten yuan.
Woman B said, "What does this mean? Ten yuan is not enough for underwear!"
The husband said, "I don't have any money either. You can buy a comb first. It's easy to see if you comb it all together!"
