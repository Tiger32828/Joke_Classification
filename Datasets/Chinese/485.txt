Attorney: Doctor, did you check your pulse before you performed the autopsy?
Witness: No.
Lawyer: Have you checked your blood pressure?
Witness: No.
Attorney: Then have you checked your breathing?
Witness: No.
Attorney: So, is it possible that when you started the autopsy, that person was actually still alive?
Witness: Impossible.
Attorney: How can you be so sure, doctor?
Witness: Because his brain was already in a jar on my desk.
Lawyer: Well...but is it possible that he was really alive at the time?
Witness: It is possible that he was not only alive but also studying law.
