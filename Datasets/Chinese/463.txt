One evening, Cindy came home from work and cooked dinner as usual.
But she noticed that the kitchen sink drain seemed to be blocked.
So she called William, the plumber, and hoped he would come to help fix it.
William agreed immediately, saying he would visit Cindy's house tomorrow afternoon.

Since it was during Cindy's working hours, Cindy told him:
"I'll put the key under the foot mat at the door, and you come in by yourself. I have a wolf dog, but he's very good, so don't worry.
Also, I have a parrot and he is a troublesome fellow. No matter what it says to you when you come in.
Remember! Never talk to parrots. "
Although William was full of doubts, he still said yes.

The next afternoon, William arrived at Cindy's house on time, went in and started fixing the kitchen sink.
The dog was very good, neither barking nor attacking him, but the parrot kept talking and barking to him.
At first William remembered Cindy's advice and ignored it, but the parrot kept yelling.

After a while William couldn't take it anymore,
He yelled at the parrot, "Shutup! You stupid bird!"
The parrot froze for a moment, and William thought his roar had some effect.
Then, the parrot was only heard to imitate Cindy's voice and say, "Doggy! Go bite him! ' Then there was only a scream from the kitchen.
