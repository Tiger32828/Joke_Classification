One morning at Xiaoming's house, Xiaoming's father was having breakfast, and Xiaoming walked over and asked his father, "Dad, do you have a heart?"
Dad pointed to the position of the heart and said, "How can the heart have legs here?"
Xiao Ming replied, "Oh!"
Then Xiao Ming walked into the kitchen and asked his mother, "Mom, does the liver have legs?"
Mom pointed to the location of the liver and said, "Silly boy, how can the liver have feet here?"
Xiao Ming said again: "But last night I clearly heard.... dear... open your feet... Â "
