A few days ago, a classmate from our class went to the coming-of-age ceremony of Cihui Hall
The next day he wore a crappy paper hat
classmates laugh at him
He said, "What are you laughing at? This is wisdom, what do you know?"
I answered directly: "You just need to talk about enlightenment, we can all understand it."
