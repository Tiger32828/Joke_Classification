The Chief Justice of England, John Wells (1685-1761), was sanctimonious and dignified in court, but his private life was often unruly.

"I heard that one of your maids is pregnant!" asked the justice. "What does that have to do with me?" "But it is rumored that Your Excellency impregnated her."
"What does that have to do with you?"
