After having dinner and smoking on the balcony, I suddenly saw a light spot in the night sky passing by in an instant!
My heart was excited: "Meteor!" So I immediately made a wish.
I made six or seven wishes, opened my eyes, I had finished smoking, and threw it out of the balcony...
Suddenly I heard the voice of a girl downstairs: "Wow! Meteor, make a wish!"
