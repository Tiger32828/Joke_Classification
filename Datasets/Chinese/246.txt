One day a taxi driver parked the taxi on the side of the road and fell asleep.
When I was sleeping soundly, I suddenly heard someone knocking on the glass. I asked what time it was, and the driver replied, "It's 10:00."
After a while, someone asked the time again, and the driver said impatiently, "10:10"
Later, the driver thought of a way. He took a piece of paper and wrote "I don't know the time" and stuck it on the window.
Suddenly he heard the sound of knocking on the glass again, and a little boy said to him, "It's 10:30 now"
