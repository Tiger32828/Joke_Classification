A tourist travels by taxi. On the way, he patted the driver on the shoulder and wanted to ask something, but he was so frightened that the driver screamed "Wow".
"Ah, sorry, didn't expect to scare you," he said apologetically.
"It's okay, little misunderstanding." The driver said, "Today is my first day driving a taxi. I have always driven a coffin in the past."
