Once, a middle-aged man came to a restaurant with an asparagus in his ear. The waiter was surprised, but dared not ask.
Since then, this customer has come every day and always has an asparagus in his ear.
Finally, the waiter decided to ask the customer.
Sure enough, the customer came again, but today it was a sage in his ear.
The waiter said, "Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me why I put a parsley in my ear?"
"Of course! You know what? I didn't get asparagus today."
