How to refuse cram school calls?
【First move】
A: "The cram school keeps calling, and it's so annoying... I told them that they were not there, and they said they would call later... Make me pretend to be my father and my sister's friend."
I:"......"
some time later! some time later! some time later! some time later!
Halfway through playing PS2! The phone rings!
A: "Oh! It's a cram school again! I really don't want to take it..."
Me: "Then I'll pick it up..."
A: "It's useless! He will still call later!"
Me: "Try it..." (pick up the phone)
Working student: "Hello? Hello..."
Me: "Hello? Hello XX cram school!"
Part-time student: "...Sorry, I made a typo..."
After that, my friend A and I laughed wildly, and the cram school didn't call again that day.
Note: The caller ID is really good~~~ XD

【Second move】

"Hello? Hello from XX Branch."
.......Kick  …  …  …
"Hello? The Bureau of Investigation is investigating one."
"....................................I'm sorry, I typed wrongly........ ."
"Hello? 119 Service Center."
"Ah???...Uh............Sorry."
.........Kick! .........
"Hello, National Army Talent Recruitment Center."
"..."
"Hello?? Here's the phone number ooxx-ooxx, we're not here now, please press 1 to find me, 2 to find my wife, 3 to find my secretary, 4 to collect debts, 5 to mib.... ............."
(press)
"Sorry, this program has an exception and will be closed soon. For details, please contact the system administrator."
"Sorry, the number you dialed is empty, please check and dial again, thank you!"
(↑This is now recorded as an answering machine... :P)

【Third move】
Found everyone to be very nice. In the second year of high school, the cram school called almost every day.
Thinking that I was in a bad mood and called the cram school once, so I greeted his mother. But only once!
When you call, girls will chat, boys...just....
My classmate (really strong)
Working student: "Excuse me, is it ***? I'm an oo cram school, can I take some time off you?"
My classmate: "No."
Working student: "Just a moment."
My classmate: "No."
Working-student: "It's really good for a while.
My classmate: "(Taiwanese) Whether you want to hang up or I want to hang up, which one is me, you will lose face."
Dudu...the other party hangs up~
After the third year of high school, I didn't answer the phone. Later, I heard a friend who was a working student in a cram school say:
Next to my classmate's name is "bad attitude", and next to mine is... "turtle hair".

【Fourth move】

God of Cookery is coming~~~ I will say the following lines when I receive a call from the cram school:
"Hello! This is the God of Cookery delivery service, what would you like sir?"
(Continued while he was still hesitating and bewildered by the hallucinations)
We currently feature the following meals:
A. Master Tang Niu's Unforgettable First Love Gold and Silver Couple's Package is an improved version of chopped noodles.
B. Double-knife turkey fish balls.
C. Stephen Zhou's ecstasy meal.
At this time, if the work-study student has not hung up the phone, he will make a sound: "Clam~~~"
I go on and on:
If you are a fine chopper, order our A special.
If you often burst into the pulp (drop race) and squirt (bladder weakness), then be sure to order the B special meal.
If you have already lost your love and are often in a down mood, then come to Guo C for a special meal.
Now, if the A+B+C meals are all ordered, we will also send the book "How to Refuse a Call from a Cram School".

【Fifth move】
Remedial class: "Excuse me, how much did you get on the test?"
Classmate: "(Attention! I'll use roar below) Don't ask me for grades!"
Remedial class: "..."
(usually they falter and want to say something... when they are about to say something)
Classmate: "Why!!~~Why~~~~~~~~~~~!! Why did I get the math problem wrong?~~"
Tutorial: "Don't get mad..." (they usually comfort you)
Classmate: "How do you want me not to be angry? Say it!"
Tutoring class: "Then do you want to tutor?"
Classmate: "Don't tell me about tutoring again!" (At this time, you must breathe very angry)
Remedial class: "Oh~~ sorry for disturbing..."

【Sixth move】
(to record first)
Me: Hey!
Supplement: Excuse me, is XXX there?
I'm sorry? ? I can't hear you...just be louder, okay? ?
Supplement: (loudly) Excuse me, is XXX there? ?
Me: I still can't hear clearly.. It seems that there is interference... Could it be louder? ?
Supplement: (extra loudly) Is XXX there? ?
me: sorry.....here is a recording of the call.....please leave what you want to say after the beep...
