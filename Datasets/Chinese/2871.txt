Two people are eating.
There was only one dish: two fish, one large and one small.
One gentleman caught the big fish, the other was furious.
"How unruly!" the man cried.
"What's the matter?" his friend asked curiously.
"You ate that big fish."
"What if you were me?"
"Of course I clip the small one."
"Well, what are you complaining about? That little fish is still there!"
