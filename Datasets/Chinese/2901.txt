A military attache was afraid of his wife. One day, his face was covered with scratches of blood. His friends were very angry and helped him come up with ideas to clean up his wife.
The military attache assembled his own troops, and ordered the sergeants to be neatly dressed and lined with swords and guns, forming a majestic formation outdoors.
The military attache's wife came out to see what happened, and then scolded: "Coward, what do you want to do by pretending to be like this?"
When the military attache heard his wife's voice, his heart skipped a beat, and he hurriedly knelt on the ground and said to his wife, "Please ma'am for a military parade!"
