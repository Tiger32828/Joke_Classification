Xiao Ming is thrifty and greedy by nature. He eats everything, but does not suffer.

Once, Xiao Ming went to the cafeteria to eat, and a gentleman sat across from him.
A plate full of hearty dishes and a piece of pork ribs that looks beautiful and delicious,
Xiao Ming really wanted to eat that pork rib, but it belonged to someone else, so Xiao Ming had to suppress the desire in his heart,
But I've been expecting a miracle, if suddenly there's a fire in his house and he has to leave immediately, then I can...

But as time passed by, the dishes on the dinner plate of the opposite gentleman also decreased bit by bit,
When there was only that coveted sparerib left, suddenly the caller on the opposite side rang,
Xiao Ming, who was already heartbroken, now has a glimmer of hope, and the evolution of things is just as Xiao Ming expected.
After reading the pager, the gentleman ignored the spare ribs that Xiao Ming had been thinking about for a long time, and immediately got up and left.

Xiao Ming saw that the opportunity could not be missed. In addition to thanking God for his help and making his dream come true,
He didn't stop his hand, and immediately started to act, with a superb technique that was too fast to cover his ears,
I put the ribs on the opposite plate directly into my mouth. When the fragrant pork ribs juice slides down the throat and the stomach along the tip of the tongue, the feeling is really indescribably comfortable.
Just when Xiao Ming was enjoying himself and was fluttering like a fairy, Xiao Ming saw the gentleman go and return,
There was also a bowl of rice in his hand, and the ribs he planned to use with this bowl of rice were in Xiao Ming's mouth,
Xiao Ming almost choked to death, and finally had to buy a piece of spareribs and give it back to others, along with a drink as spiritual compensation.

This is the only true story of Xiao Ming who was willing to spend his own money to buy spare ribs during his four years of college.
