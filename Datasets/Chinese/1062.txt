When the night was quiet, when Nobita was watching TV at home, there was a sudden scream from the neighbor Aqin's house. Nobita leaned against the wall and listened carefully and found that Aqin kept shouting: "I'm so mad! I want to Blow you up with a bomb!"
Nobita was so frightened that he rushed out the door and even called the police. It wasn't until the police arrived at the scene that they broke into the door and found that nothing had happened. Nobita quickly explained: "I thought she was going to detonate a bomb!"
After hearing this, Aqin said embarrassedly, "Alas! They are playing online games. They are so addicted to it that they can't help it!"
Everyone: "..."
