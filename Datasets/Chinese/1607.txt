Friends A and B meet for a drink before marriage.
A said, "I asked my fianc√©e, and she blushed and whispered that her breasts looked like oranges. I thought that oranges should be oranges. We look too ordinary, and one orange is enough for me to eat for the rest of my life."
B said, "I also asked my daughter-in-law, who has never been there, and she blushed and whispered to me that her breasts are like eggs. I thought that eggs are just eggs. Our family is poor, and one egg is enough for a lifetime."

The two chose to get married on the same day and meet for a drink the next day.
A said, "I was deceived by my daughter-in-law. I never imagined that kumquats are also called oranges."
B said, "I also ate my daughter-in-law's dumb loss, and poached eggs are also called eggs."
