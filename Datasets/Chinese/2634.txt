Sir: Where are the allusions to "contradiction", please give some examples of contradictions.
Student A: "I don't know the contradictory story, but it's too easy to give an example. For example, a teacher knows about it, but asks me all about it. This is a contradiction."
Teacher: "This is not appropriate."
Student B: "It's obviously very appropriate, but the teacher says no, which is also a contradiction."
Teacher: "This is nonsense."
Student C: "The teacher taught us to speak, but this would be called "nonsense" again. It cannot be denied that it is a big contradiction."
Teacher: "(face ashen)"
Student D: "Why doesn't the teacher speak?"
Teacher: "When I open my mouth, you say it's a contradiction, but now I simply don't say it."
Student E: "Ha, contradictory."
