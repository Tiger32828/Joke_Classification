John became mayor of Pittsburgh thanks to the assistance of his wife, Lancey.
One day, he and Lanxi went to inspect a construction site. A worker wearing a protective cap greeted them and said jokingly:
"Lancy, do you remember? We used to date in high school!"
After that, John deliberately teased Lancey and said, "Don't you feel lucky to marry me? You should be the wife of a construction worker, not the mayor's wife."
Lansey replied, "It's not me but you that's lucky. I think he'd be mayor of Pittsburgh if we didn't get married."
