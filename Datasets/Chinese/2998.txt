A politician in a certain country is debating with a surgeon and an engineer about which profession on earth matters.
"The Bible says that Eve grew out of Adam's rib," said the surgeon. "Of course, that's not possible without surgery, so my profession is the most important."
The engineer immediately retorted: "No! The world was created by God in 6 days out of chaos. It was a huge project. After that, Adam and Eve could not be talked about."
The politician said gracefully, "Gentlemen, who caused the chaos?"
