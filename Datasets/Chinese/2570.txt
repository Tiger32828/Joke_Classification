One day, the father said to his daughter, "Daughter, if you don't actively look for a partner, who can endure your age?"
Daughter: "I'm waiting for the golden turtle son-in-law to appear!"
Father: "Don't wait for the golden turtle son-in-law, what you want now is the ninja turtle!"
Years later, the daughter finally found the right person and talked about marriage.
The father asked his daughter, "Does your fianc√© know your age?"
Daughter: "Yes, he knows part of it." Father: "It's good to add."
