Once upon a time, there was a small turtle, and he saw a huge creature in the sea. He thought it was very strange, what is so big?
So he asked him, "What is it?"
He replied: "I am a dragon"
A hundred years later, the little turtle has turned into a big turtle, and he met the dragon again one day, but he didn't get bigger at all.
He asked him again, "Strange, what kind of dragon are you, why don't you grow up?"

The dragon replied, "Because I am Styrofoam."
