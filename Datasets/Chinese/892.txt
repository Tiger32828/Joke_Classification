One night, I was going to make instant noodles in my room. I wanted to add an egg to supplement nutrition. I somehow slipped my hand and spilled some egg whites on the ground. I took the toilet paper and prepared to clean it up. At this time... My classmate opened the door and came in, and saw that I was shirtless and wearing underwear, holding toilet paper, and there was still unknown mucus on the toilet paper.
The student asked:
"Dig it!! It's all over the place!! How long have you been accumulating?"
"No... I accidentally got on the ground while cooking noodles"


"You cook noodles and add that?!"
