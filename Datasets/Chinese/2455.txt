On a train bound for Europe, in the same compartment sat a Russian, a Cuban, an American businessman and an American lawyer.
On the way, the Russians took out a bottle of vodka, poured everyone one by one, and then threw the remaining half of the bottle out the window.
"Aren't you too wasteful?" the American businessman asked in amazement.
"Russia has vodka," the Russian said proudly. "We can't finish it."
After a while, the Cuban handed out some Havana cigars to his companions, and he lit one himself, but threw it out the window before taking a few puffs.
The American businessman asked curiously: "I think Cuba's economy is not very prosperous, why is such a good cigar thrown away?"
"In Cuba, we have cigars, and we can't smoke them all," the Cuban said nonchalantly.
The American businessman was silent for a while, then suddenly stood up, picked up the lawyer beside him, and forced him out the window.
