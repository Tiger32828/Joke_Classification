When the flag was lowered one day, like everyone else, I focused on listening to the lectures of the teachers on the stage.
I don't know why, maybe I drank too much water that day! From the whole team to the playground to gather,
For three full minutes, I was "hiccupping" all the time! Despite strong restraint, Hiccup is just unrestrained slamming. I thought no one would hear it, so let's hold on until the flag is lowered!
Unexpectedly, there were rude laughter of "Wahhaha" and "Aahah" beside him! Suddenly, an ominous wave came to my heart, and I was heard!
I pretended to be calm and asked those classmates, "ã„Ÿ...Is it...that funny?" But they said:
"Hahaha! It's so funny! Your burp sounds like... that grandpa Ranma's laughter!"
Immediately, I imagined that my facial features were sticking to the strange old man's face, and I would make "duh, duh, duh" hiccup sounds from time to time. OMG! Just let me die!
