A young nun who has the habit of not wearing clothes when she sleeps.
One day, because she got up too late, she didn't have time to put on her underwear and trousers, only covered the Tao and went to the morning class with the crowd.
She sat cross-legged on the spot and began to chant the scriptures. Unexpectedly, the Taoist uniform she was wearing was shorter, so she would be seen clearly by the monks sitting cross-legged across from her.
The monk who knocked on the wooden fish passed the message to the other monks while knocking... "Nun Mou please speak... Nun Mou please speak" (Taiwanese) (without pants) (without pants)
Another monk also knocked on the wooden fish and said in his mouth: "Arriving at the place... Arriving at the place" (where) (where)
At this time, the rhythm was changed, and the bronze chimes and gongs were beaten instead. Another monk knocked and said, "Diandian...frame...Diandian...frame" (quietly look) (quietly look)
