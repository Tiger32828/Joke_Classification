Wang Laowu is often drunk, and every time he goes home late, he is always scolded by his wife.
One day, Wang Laowu came back later than usual. He carefully took off his shoes at the door, and crept to the cradle, humming a lullaby and rocking the cradle.
The wife heard his voice and asked, "What are you doing?"
"Oh, you're so ugly!"
Wang Laowu blamed his wife: "How did you become a mother? The child has been crying for an hour and is tired from crying. I have been sitting and shaking him!"
"Who are you lying to?" the wife exclaimed, "The child has been sleeping beside me for over an hour!"
Wang Laowu looked at it and realized that he was rocking an empty cradle.
