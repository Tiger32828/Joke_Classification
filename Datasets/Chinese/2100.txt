A man went to visit his friend, but his friend was not there, only his friend's wife was there, and his friend's wife was very beautiful, so he became evil.
However, my friend's wife found out...
So I said to my friend, "My husband will be back in an hour~"
The friend said in fright, "I didn't do anything, please forgive me."
At this point the lady said, "I didn't blame you, I just reminded you."
