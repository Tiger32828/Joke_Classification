My husband rarely remembers our wedding anniversary.
I was only nineteen when I married him, and by the twentieth wedding anniversary, I thought he would at least remember this meaningful day.
That knows otherwise! He didn't say a word. However, that night he said, "You know what?" and stopped.
I'm glad to think that he finally remembered it, waiting for him to go on.
