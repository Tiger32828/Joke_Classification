It is said that Mr. Ma is a veteran of mahjong.
One day, the blackboard was dirty...

The teacher scolded: "Which one is a villager, why don't you clean the whiteboard!"
Student on duty: "Teacher, the blackboard is dirty from yesterday. It should be blamed on the student on duty yesterday. Why do you want me to wipe it?"
Teacher: "If you want to wipe it, just wipe it, what are you doing there!"
"Seven requests, eight requests, listen to six or nine." The student on duty whispered.
Teacher: "If you talk nonsense again, I'll hit you!"
Born on duty: "If you hit me, it's rubbish!"
