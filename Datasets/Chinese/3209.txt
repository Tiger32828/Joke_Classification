A class of six-year-olds listened intently to the teacher telling the story of the birth of Jesus.
The teacher talked about Mary and Joseph arriving in Bethlehem, but there was no room in the inn, and suddenly someone interrupted.
One child screeched in dissatisfaction, "I said Joseph was wrong. He should have pre-booked the room."
