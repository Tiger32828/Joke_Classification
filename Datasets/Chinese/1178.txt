A man is reading a book called "Man is the Head of the House",
Seeing the arrogance, I rushed into the kitchen,
He stretched out a finger and shook it in front of his wife and said:
"From now on, you must obey my orders, what I say is what I say!

Tonight, you must prepare good food and drink, and serve me with my meal;
Then help me take a bath, wipe my back, dry my body, bring a bathrobe,
And help me massage my hands and feet.
After the massage, guess who helped me get dressed and brush my hair? "

His wife answered indifferently:
"Is it someone from the funeral home?"
