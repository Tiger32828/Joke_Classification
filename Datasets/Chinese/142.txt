One day, the Ministry of Education sent an inspector to the school to conduct a random inspection. Wanting to understand the education level of the school, he asked a random student to ask him, "Who burned the Epang Palace?"
As a result, the student became very nervous and said, "I didn't burn it!" At this time, the inspector felt that the school's teaching was not good.
Then he said to the principal of the school, "Your school is not good at teaching. I asked your student who burned the Epang Palace, and he actually told me that he didn't burn it."
At this time, the principal said unhappily: "I told you that my students are the most honest, and he said that he did not burn them."
The inspector shook his head and left. I went back and reported to the minister: "A certain school is not running well. I asked the student who burned the Epang Palace. The student said it wasn't him who burned it. The principal also endorsed that he did not burn it.
The minister shook his head and said, "Well, it's not good... But if it burns, it will burn, and the headquarters will allocate funds for reconstruction."
