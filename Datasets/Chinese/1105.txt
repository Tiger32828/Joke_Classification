On this day, Lao Gao met Axiu because of a misunderstanding on the MRT, and the two began to chat from all over the world.
Lao Gao: "This lady, do you have a son?"
Axiu: "Yes, I have a son."
Lao Gao: "Hey, this son of mine smokes every day, and he smokes quite a lot. I really can't do anything about it. Does your son also smoke?"
Axiu shook her head and said, "No, he doesn't smoke."
Lao Gao: "Your son is really good. My son comes home very late every night, and sometimes he doesn't come home at all! Does this happen to your family too?"
Axiu shook her head and said, "My son is at home every day."
Lao Gao: "Oh! Your son is really good!"
Axiu: "No, after all, my son is only six months old!"
Lao Gao: "..."
