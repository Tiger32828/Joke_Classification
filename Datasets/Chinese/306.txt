On Saturday afternoon, Kangkang came back from tutoring and sat in the living room to do his homework.
At this moment, the doorbell rang suddenly, and the sensible Kangkang hurried to open the door. Kangkang saw a handsome and tall man standing there.
I was wondering who he was when my mother came out of the kitchen and saw him with a happy smile. Then my mother suddenly turned around and said to Kangkang, "Call Dad!"
Kangkang thought to himself, "It's so strange, who is this man, why do I call him dad, is it mom...?"
Seeing that Kangkang didn't move at all, Mom said to Kangkang again, "Call Dad!"
Kangkang was still indifferent, staring at his mother and the man, and decided to use silence to represent his last human dignity.
Mom said loudly and threateningly, "Call me Dad!"
Kangkang and his mother were deadlocked. Mom was anxious and angry, she stretched out her right hand and slapped Kang Kang fiercely, and yelled, "Call Dad!"
Kangkang was suddenly dumbfounded. He didn't expect that his mother would beat him for a strange man. Kangkang cried out in sadness and said to the stranger, "Dad..."
At this time, my mother said, "You idiot! Does he hear you calling Dad like that? They come to repair the water tower, so hurry up and call Dad in the room and take him upstairs to the top floor."
