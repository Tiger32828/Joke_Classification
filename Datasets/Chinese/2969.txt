A nationally renowned botany professor and his teaching assistants are working on a new variety.
Suddenly the teaching assistant asked, "Professor, what should I do if I come across a plant I don't know during the practice class?"
The professor replied: "In order to avoid questions from my classmates, I usually walk at the front and trample all the plants I don't know to death."
