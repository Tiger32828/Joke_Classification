A young couple goes to an art exhibition. Wife is a high myopia,
She stood in front of a large painting and looked at it carefully for a long time, and then shouted loudly:
"My God! Why is this woman so ugly?"
"Honey, don't make a fuss," the husband hurriedly stepped forward and told his wife quietly,
"It's not a painting, it's a mirror."
