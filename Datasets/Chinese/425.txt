The weather is getting cold again, and there is a slight drizzle.

The two brothers were going to visit a department store, and after passing the bank near the bus stop, they wanted to go to the ATM outside the bank to get some money, but they happened to meet the money transporter loading money.

The two stood by the ATM and waited for a long time, their hands almost freezing, and they had to endure the suspicious eyes of the security guards from time to time.
As usual, my brother asked me briefly, "Are you freezing your hands?" I answered as usual, "Freezing your hands!"

Moment - Two of the four security guards' gun heads turned towards us.
Brother seems stunned! No explanation is given!

I was anxious~ I shouted loudly to my brother: "Brother~ They are like this, why are you still not talking?"
In an instant~ the four gun heads of the four security guards all turned.

After being turned to the police station~
The police asked my brother, "What's your name?"
My brother: "Jiang Yingyu."
The police raised his voice slightly: "What's your name?!"
My brother: "Jiang Yingyu."
The policeman said loudly, "Your ~what ~what ~name~character?"
Brother also loudly replied: "Jiang ~ Ying ~ Yu ~"
Policeman: "Wow~! Okay, okay, okay, what is your name?"
Brother is angry ~ silence is right! The police are helpless

He turned to me and asked, "What is your name?"
I was a little scared and quickly answered him: "Jiang Guoyu"
