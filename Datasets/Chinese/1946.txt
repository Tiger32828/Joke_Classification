Xiao Ming: "A rabbit races against a fast tortoise, who wins?"
Teacher: "Rabbit."
Xiao Ming: "Wrong! The tortoise won. The previous article explained that it was a fast tortoise. Teacher, you are not attentive in reading the question, so you must combine it with the context!"
Teacher: "Come on again, if you don't believe me, you won't be able to beat this little brat!"
Xiao Ming: "The rabbit was unwilling just now. The next day, he found a tortoise wearing sunglasses and ran a race with him. Who won?"
Teacher: "Rabbit, the context didn't explain that this tortoise ran very fast."
Xiao Ming: "Wrong! This tortoise took off his sunglasses. Oh, la la, it's the fast tortoise from yesterday! Teacher, have you never studied probability theory?"
