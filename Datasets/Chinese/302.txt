Farmer Xiao Ming caught a big fish in the river, and happily returned home and said to his wife, "Look, we have fried fish to eat!"
"No oil." "Then cook!"
"No pot." "Grilled fish!"
"No firewood."

Xiao Ming was so angry that he walked to the river and threw the fish back. The fish made a semicircle in the water, and the upper body came out of the water,
He raised his right fin and shouted excitedly, "Long live the president!"
