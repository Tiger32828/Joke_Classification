One day my wife accompanied Lao Wang to play golf, and the first shot hit the bushes,
"Oh shit!, missed!" Old Wang cursed.
The wife said, "If you continue to swear, you will be struck to death by lightning."
Another shot, this time he fell into the bunker, and Pharaoh scolded again: "Oh shit! Another missed shot!"
Just after saying "Boom!", a bolt of lightning struck his wife to death.
At this time, I only heard a voice from the sky...


"Ohshit!!, I missed it again!"
