That day, the teacher in class happened to tell the story of Washington cutting down the cherry tree, which made Xiao Ming decide to be an honest child.
After returning home, he confessed to his father that he kicked down the toilet, thinking that he would be praised by his father, but unexpectedly, his father gave him two slaps.
Xiao Ming choked up and said to his father, "When Washington told the truth, his father forgave him. Why are you not like Washington's father?"
The father said earnestly to Xiao Ming, "Son, that's because Washington's father was not in the tree at the time."
