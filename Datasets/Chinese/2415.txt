The wife went back to her parents' house, the son went to bed, and Xiao Wang was playing on the computer in the living room alone.
Xiao Wang's sister-in-law came to play and stayed at home tonight.
It was midnight, and he found that his sister-in-law was still sleeping with the door open! The snow-white arms were too conspicuous in the unlit room.
Xiao Wang couldn't help but approached, thinking, "Is there a door reserved for me? I usually close the door early and go to bed."
Xiao Wang's heart was beating wildly, but his conscience forced him to close the door and prepare to play on the computer.
Suddenly the sister-in-law shouted, "Don't close the door!"
He burst into ecstasy, and hurriedly opened the door and asked, "Is there any need?"
Sister-in-law: "Close the door and you won't receive wifi, so leave the door open!"
