Once upon a time, there was a poor couple who dared not have children because their family was really poor.
One day, my husband went on a business trip to the city and stopped by the pharmacy, so he bought insurance from the owner of the pharmacy
He asked, "How much does this black one cost?"
The boss replied, "It costs ten dollars!"
He saw another white one and asked the boss, "What about this one?"
The boss saw that he didn't seem to have much money, so he casually said, "This quality is better, and it costs twenty dollars!"
He calculated for a long time, because he really had no money, he had to buy a black one.
When he got home, he saw a black postman hurried out of his house,
He thought that he might be rushing to deliver the letter, but he ignored it.
But not long after, his wife gave birth to a boy, and when the child grew up,
One day, I went home crying and told my dad that all my classmates laughed at him.
His father told him very earnestly: "Child! It's just that Dad lost ten dollars at that time."
