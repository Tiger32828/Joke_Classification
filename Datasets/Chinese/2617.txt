The husband was in the kitchen watching his wife cooking, and he kept nagging.
"You add too much oil!" "Be careful! The fire is too hot, turn the fish over quickly."
"Ah, you have to add the garlic first, then the shallots at the end... The pot is crooked, hurry up and straighten it."
The more the wife listened, the more angry she became: "Shut up, I don't need you to teach me how to cook!"
The husband said calmly, "Honey, I know you can cook, I just want you to experience it. That's how I feel when I'm driving and you sit next to me."
