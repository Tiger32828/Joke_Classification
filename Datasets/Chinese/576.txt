One day a woman took her child to a train.
An Obasan passed by her seat and saw the child,
He couldn't help shaking his head and said softly, "Alas! How can there be such an ugly child!"
After hearing this, the woman couldn't help crying. The unsuspecting train service lady saw that the woman was crying so sadly for some unknown reason.
So he wanted to comfort the woman and said to the woman, "Don't be sad, drink a glass of water and take a rest.
Oh yes, there's another banana here, just give it to your monkey! "
