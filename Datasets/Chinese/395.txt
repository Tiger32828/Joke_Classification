Policeman: "Sir, you drive so fast, do you know how much you will be fined? How much can the money be used for, do you know?"
Driver: "I know, it's enough for me to take my driver's license test!"
Police: "What! Are you driving without a license?"

While arguing, the driving wife quickly got out of the car ﹏﹏﹏
Wife: "Sir, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, he's just like this, he talks nonsense after drinking a little wine, don't be serious!"
Policeman: "Ah! Drunk driving without a license! Okay, let's take a drink test!"

At this time, the old lady in the back seat was woken up by the chatter and got out of the car angrily!
The old lady asked, "Why are you so noisy?"
Driver: "Mom, it's alright! The car was stopped by the police for driving too fast."
The old lady: "Didn't I tell you earlier, don't drive the stolen car too fast?"

police:"............."
