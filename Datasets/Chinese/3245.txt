Li Xiucai, who would not be successful, gave birth to two sons and named them Success and Failure.
One day, before going out, Li Xiucai instructed his wife to urge his two sons to practice calligraphy, and stipulated that the older ones should write 300 characters and the younger ones should write 200 characters.
After returning home, Li Xiucai asked the lady about her calligraphy practice.
The lady replied, "Both of them have written, but they are not successful enough, and there are more failures. Everyone wrote two hundred and fifty crosses."
