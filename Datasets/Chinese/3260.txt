On this day, three people are comparing who is the boss. The three are: the lame, the blind, and the bald.
They use one sentence to describe themselves as the boss.
So the lame man spoke first, and the lame man said, "I am independent, so I am the boss!
The blind man said unwillingly, "I am defiant, so I am the boss!"
The bald man finally said: I am lawless, so I am the real boss!
