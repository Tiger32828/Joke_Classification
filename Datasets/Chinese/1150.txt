When I was in class, I asked the students about their volunteers,
The result is nothing but the ambition to be an engineer, a scientist, a doctor in the future...
Only one student said he would be a philanthropist in the future.
When I heard it, I was immediately impressed by this student.
So I asked him why?

He replied, "Teacher, do you think that if you don't have a lot of money, you can be a philanthropist?"
