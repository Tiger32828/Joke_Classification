There was a man with only three hairs. One day, he went to a hair stylist.
Shop clerk: "What kind of hairstyle do you want to design?"
Customer: "Well...I have no opinion, you can make up your mind."
Shop clerk: "Then I'll help you make it up."
In the process of tying up the bag, the clerk accidentally lost a hair:
Shop clerk: "Sir, sir, one of my hair fell out, what should I do?"
Customer: "Oh, it doesn't matter; then please help me get a mid-part haircut."
In the process of combing my hair, another hair fell out.
Clerk: "Sir, sir, I lost another hair."
Customer: "Forget it, I'll go back with my hair down."
