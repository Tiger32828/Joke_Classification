When a couple stayed in a hotel,
The wife wanted to take a shower but worried and said to her husband, "I read reports that some hotels or restaurants have hidden video cameras. What should I do if they are actually filmed?"
Husband said with a look of disdain, "Don't worry! Even if you are photographed, it will be cut off!"
