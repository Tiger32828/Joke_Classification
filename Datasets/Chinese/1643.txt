One day, in the nursing home, Lao Chen and Lao Li chatted to the point where time was not forgiving...
Old Chen: "Recalling my childhood, the happiest time was Children's Day"
Lao Li: "In ten years it will be Youth Day"
Lao Chen: "Father's Day will be celebrated in ten years"
Lao Li: "In ten years it will be the Double Ninth Festival"
Old Chen: "Then in ten years..."
Lao Li: "... Qingming Festival!"
