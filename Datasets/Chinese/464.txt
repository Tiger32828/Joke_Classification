There is an aunt who has watched a lot of mainland drama Harem Zhenhuan, and she is very suspicious.
When I went to buy buns for breakfast in the morning, the aunt took out a silver needle from her pocket and pierced it, and the tip of the silver needle turned black!
She exclaimed, "The steamed buns are poisonous! Who wants to harm Ben Gong?"
The room full of guests instantly fell silent,
At this time, the boss calmly walked forward and slapped him: "Bitch! This is a sesame bun!"
