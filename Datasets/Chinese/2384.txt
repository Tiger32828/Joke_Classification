Someone bought a big barrel of fine wine on Christmas Eve and kept it outdoors.

The next day he found that a quarter was missing, so he affixed the words "No Stealing Alcohol" on the barrel.

On the third day, the wine had been reduced by a quarter, and he was very angry and posted the words "Whoever steals alcohol is killed without mercy".

On the fourth day, the wine was still stolen, only a quarter of it was left, and his lungs were about to explode!

One of his friends found out about this and said to him, "You idiot! You wouldn't put the word 'urine bucket' on a wine barrel, and see who else steals it! He thought it made sense, so he complied.

On the fifth day he criedâ€”the bucket was full.
