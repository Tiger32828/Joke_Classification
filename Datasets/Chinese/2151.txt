Before the exam, Xiaohong said to Xiaoming, "If you can take the first place in the class this time, I will be your girlfriend."
The whole class heard it, and everyone silently put down the pen, intending to hand in a blank.
Xiao Ming's eyes were filled with tears, he glanced at Xiao Hong, who was stubbornly backed, and silently tore off the test paper and ate it.
Xiaohong smiled slightly and wrote Xiaoming's name on her test paper...

This is the most twisted love story I've ever heard.
