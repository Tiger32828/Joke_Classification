Someone wanted to borrow an ox from a rich man, so he sent a servant to the rich man with a letter to borrow an ox.
The rich man was accompanying the guest, so he pretended to read the letter because he was afraid that the guest would know that he could not read.
He nodded while watching, and then said to the person who came, "I see, I'll go by myself in a while."
