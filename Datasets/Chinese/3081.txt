Three southern priests were having lunch in a small restaurant. One of them said:
"Did you know? My church's attic and top floor have been infested with bats since summer,
I've tried everything - noise, spray, cats - nothing seems to keep them away. "
Another said, "Yeah, me too. There are hundreds in my bell tower and attic, too.
I once asked someone to fumigate the whole place and it couldn't get rid of it. "
The third pastor said, "I baptize all the bats in my place,
Make them a part of the church...and from now on! Not even one came back. "
