In the company, A, B, and C pursue a girl at the same time.
In a colleague's party, the girl accidentally farted, in order not to make the girl too embarrassed...
A stood up and admitted: "I'm sorry, I put the fart." The girl then showed gratitude to him.
Not long after she accidentally farted again, and B also wanted to be courteous, so he also stood up and said that he did the fart, and the girl also felt very relieved.
It didn't take long for the girl to fart for the third time. At this time, C thought, the two must not be allowed to focus on beauty!
So he hurriedly stood up and said loudly, "This fart and her future farts are all mine!"
