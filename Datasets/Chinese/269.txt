A man went to apply for a mobile phone, and he shyly took out two documents.
The lady at the counter looked at the name column: Gao Sai.
She glanced at the man, who bowed his head in embarrassment.
At this moment, Miss Smart immediately eased each other's embarrassment,
Said: What a coincidence! My husband has the same name as you but a different surname... My husband's last name is Jia.
The man fell off his chair when he heard it.
