The ten wives who were afraid of their wives, each suffering from their cruelty, gathered to donate blood one by one and swore to support each other.
When the gods were rewarded with drinking, unexpectedly, a few women heard it, and they all rushed to the alliance place. Nine people jumped and jumped in shock, but the only one was sitting still.
Everyone who was afraid of his wife admired and said, "Let him be the eldest brother." Before that, the woman dispersed, and everyone discovered that this man had been frightened and died for a long time.
