Thackeray (182-1863), the famous British writer who wrote "Vanity Fair", devoted his life to helping others and never left his name for good deeds.
When he knew that his friend was in trouble, he often used aliases, pseudonyms or even anonymous remittances to help his friends.
When sending the money, he put the money in a used medicine box and attached a "doctor's order" that stated "how to take it":
"Take one tablet at a time, "take it" in an emergency!"
