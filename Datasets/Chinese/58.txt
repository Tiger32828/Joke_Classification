When a legislator visited a mental hospital, he asked the director, "How to judge whether a mentally ill patient can be discharged?"

"We will fill a bathtub with water, then provide a spoon, a teacup and a bucket to the patient, and ask him to drain the bathtub," the dean said.
"Oh! I see."

"A normal person would choose a bucket because it is bigger than both a spoon and a teacup," the legislator said.

"Do not!"

The dean said, "A normal person would just pull up the stopper at the bottom of the bathtub. Ah... Would you like to arrange a bed by the window for you?"
