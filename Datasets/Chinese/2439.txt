A movie star is sitting in the lobby of a hotel when an obnoxious person begins to scold him.
The actor ignored his insults, but the two female fans couldn't help it.
Not only did they scold the talkative man, but they beat him until the man ran out.
The star thanked two women for their support and asked one woman:
"Did you really slap that person with this beautiful little hand?"
"Yes," she replied, and the actor kissed her hand graciously.
He turned to another woman, who immediately declared: "I bit him with my mouth."
