When I was in the second or third grade of elementary school, when other children of the same age,
I can't wet the bed anymore, I don't know why, but I still have the same old problem.
Once when I was taking a nap at school, I actually stole my pee again, and not only did it soak in the pee, but also delivered a lump of poo.
The outrageous thing is that the person involved, I, didn't even notice it, and it was someone else who woke me up because of the smell! what! Really embarrassing!
