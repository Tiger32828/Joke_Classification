During the Indian Independence Movement, lying on the rails was one of the non-violent means commonly used by freedom fighters to destroy railway traffic.
When this happened in Deladen, the infantry regiment was called to deal with the situation.
The soldiers lifted the man lying on the track off the track and stuffed it into the waiting police car.
But what about women lying on the rails? Touching or roughing them up would be outrageous.
The commander came up with a clever idea: tell the soldier to lie down next to the woman and not touch her. The woman panicked and got up and ran away.
