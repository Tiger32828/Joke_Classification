Old man Fan bought a house for his son and went to the scene to go through the installment payment procedures and registration. The bank clerk said, "Sir, do you pay quarterly or monthly."
When the old man heard the fire, he said, "I'm not a fucking stepfather, nor a father-in-law, I'm... a father"
So the salesman ticked the application form...pay in one go.
