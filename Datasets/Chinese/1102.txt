Dapeng: "Alas... I only got 25 points in the test."

Ah Zhan: "I'm luckier than you, I got 10 percent in the test."
Dapeng: "You obviously scored lower than me in the test, where is your luck?"
Ah Zhan: "Because if I want to be seventy, I just need to add a line on top of the "1", and if I want to be one hundred, I just need to add an extra 0 after the "0", but you But can't."
Dapeng: "..."
