There was a man who was in prison for a long time. Not long after he was released from prison, he stole a motorcycle because of his livelihood. When he was halfway, the car could not move, so he pushed it to the gas station in front of him to refuel!
It was discovered by the gas operator that he was stealing the car, and he immediately called the police.
When the police came and took the thief away, they asked, "Fueler, how did you know it was a car theft?"
The oiler said, "Xunbei has been adding oil for more than ten years. This is the first time I see someone pushing an 'electric car' to refuel."
The thief said with tears, "It's been too long, the changes outside are too great!"
