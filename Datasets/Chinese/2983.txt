A fifty-year-old man has a thirty-year-old son. This son is very lazy, never does anything, and depends on his father for food and clothing.
The old man was very worried about his son, so he took his son to fortune-telling. The fortune teller predicted that the father would live to be eighty years old and the son would live to be sixty-two years old.
The son was very sad when he learned about his father's and his own lifespan. The father comforted his son and said, "Don't be sad! You are only 30 years old, and you still have 32 years to live!"
The son replied, "I'm not worried about my life, but your life makes me sad."
Hearing this, my father was very moved and said with tears in his eyes, "You don't have to be too sad! I still have 30 years to live!"
The son said, "I don't care about your lifespan. I've thought about it carefully. You will die two years earlier than me, and who will I depend on for two more years?"
