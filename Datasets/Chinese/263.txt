During the Chinese class, the teacher shook A-Xiong, who was sleeping soundly, to wake him up.
He asked, "Ah Xiong, who wrote The Story of the West Chamber?"
Ah Xiong just woke up and quickly replied, "Teacher Report, it's not me."
The whole class burst into laughter.​​

The teacher said angrily: "Go to the back and stand for ten minutes! And you don't have to come to my class again."
The next day, the parents of the students took the students to apologize to the teacher: "My child is not very smart, but he never lies. What is the book called The West Wing, it really wasn't written by him!"
