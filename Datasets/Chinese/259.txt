There was a biology quiz, and there was only one question:
What do the three "cavities, rotten carrots, and pregnant women" have in common?
As a result, all but three of the class took duck eggs.
Two of them scored 80 points,
Their answer was: "It's all bugs!"
Only one 100 points,
"It's too slow!" he said.
