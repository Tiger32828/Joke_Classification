A doctor in a neurological hospital asked a patient, "If I cut off one of your ears...what would happen to you?"
The patient replied, "Then I won't hear..."
The doctor listened... ummm....it's normal...
The doctor asked again, "Then...if I cut off your other ear...what would happen to you?"
The patient replied, "Then I won't be able to see..."
The doctor began to get nervous: "Why can't I see it...?"
The patient replied: "Because the glasses will fall off..."
