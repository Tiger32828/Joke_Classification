One day, a rich man kept an obedient elephant. Today was the rich man's birthday, so he invited his relatives and friends to participate.
Everyone chatted, and the rich man said, "I want to hold an event!"
After bringing everyone to the pool, he said, "I'll give him one million who can use the elephant in the pool."
Everyone pushed and squeezed without success.
So another poor boy came over and said, "Isn't it possible to get a million if you push it into the pool no matter what method you use?"
The rich man nodded, and the poor boy immediately ran to the side of the elephant and grabbed its balls. When the elephant jumped, he jumped into the swimming pool, and the rich man had to give the poor boy one million.
The same event will be held for the rich man's birthday next year, but the rich man said, "I'll say it first, I can't hurt my elephant."
The poor boy came again, and he ran to the elephant again and said, "Do you want to be the same as last time?" The elephant shook his head.
The poor boy said again, "Then jump down by yourself!"
