On the way home from get off work, I bought a piece of fragrant chicken chop and went home to satisfy my hunger.
The proprietress is a kind young woman who skillfully frys all kinds of ingredients in the frying pan until crispy.
While waiting, a pair of five- or six-year-old brothers walked in and shouted in childish voices:

"Boss lady! I want 30 yuan of French fries, divided into three portions!"
The proprietress asked inexplicably, "You are only two, why do you have to divide it into three?"
The older child said, "Because my mother eats too!"

The surrounding customers couldn't help but smile with admiration, admiring the two brothers for their filial piety at such a young age.
Unexpectedly, the child went on to say:
"If it's packed into a bag, Mom will eat it quickly!"
