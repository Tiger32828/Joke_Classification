My new girlfriend in my sophomore year, and the relationship gradually progressed, so I went to the hotel as a matter of course.
So tragedy struck, when I walked into a nice looking hotel with my girlfriend and asked for the price,
The proprietress said politely: "Oh, they are all old customers, and the price is still the same!"
