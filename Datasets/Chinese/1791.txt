When I was young, my mother threatened to beat me with a belt when I made a mistake.
With a flash of inspiration, I deliberately said, "Hey, you don't dare, hit me with your belt, and your pants will be gone!"
Mom suddenly turned around and pulled out Dad's belt and rushed over.
Dad watched with his pants on.
