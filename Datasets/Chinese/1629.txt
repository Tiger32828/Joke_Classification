A mother took a taxi to pick up her daughter from high school.
The mother and daughter passed through a certain section of road, and they saw all the coquettishly dressed street girls who started to stand by the roadside "doing business".
The adolescent daughter asked curiously, "Mom, what are those women doing standing by the road?"
In order not to affect her daughter's young and innocent heart, her mother replied, "Those women are waiting for their husbands."
The talkative taxi driver said on the side: "Laughter, everyone knows that those women are prostitutes."
Mom glared at the driver angrily.
The daughter then asked, "Mom, will that prostitute have children?"
Mom said coldly, "Of course I will, otherwise who will drive the taxi."
