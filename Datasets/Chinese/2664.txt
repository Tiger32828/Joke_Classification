A son who is addicted to gambling is asking his mother for money again: "If you don't give me money again, I really have to follow my original plan."
The old mother thought he was going to commit suicide, and hurriedly gave him the money, but she asked him, "Otherwise, what are your plans?"
The son took the money and said, "I'm going to quit gambling."
