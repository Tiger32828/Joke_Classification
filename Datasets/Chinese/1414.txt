A woman went to a sex store to buy an electric massage stick…
"boss!"
"Miss, what are you buying?"
"I heard that you have the latest electric massage stick."
"Yes, yes, yes! It's all in the top row of the shelf, pick them out and tell me. Sorry, I'm a little busy and can't say hello to you!"
"Okay, thank you! I'll choose it myself."
A few minutes later…
"Miss, have you made your choice yet?" the boss asked
"It's picked."
"Well, which one do you want?"
"The red one in the far corner!"
"The corner..." The boss glanced at it. "Miss! That 'fire extinguisher'! I'm busy, so don't make fun of me, okay?"
"Ah (blush)... I'm sorry." The woman looked again... "Then... Boss, I want the gray one."
"Gray?" The boss went back and looked at it. "Miss ㄟ, how about the 'gas canister'? Don't make trouble if you don't buy it..."
