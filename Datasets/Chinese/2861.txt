A clerk got lazy and pissed off his boss.
"I've never seen someone as useless as you!"
The boss was furious: "You can't do an hour's work a month. Let's talk about it, what's the benefit of the company hiring you?"
The clerk thought for a moment and replied, "When I go on vacation, I don't have any extra work left to do."
