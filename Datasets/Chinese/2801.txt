A young woman walked across the street and suddenly saw a child born in pink and jade. She stepped forward and grabbed the child's hand and said, "Little girl, kiss my auntie."
The child coyly broke away from the woman's hand and said to an old man next to him, "Grandpa, I'm afraid, you should come and kiss!"
