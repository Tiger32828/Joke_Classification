There are three children who are faster than their father!
The first child said: My dad was the fastest, the coffee cup fell off the table and he could catch the cup before it fell to the ground.
The second kid said, "My dad is fast. He goes hunting and shoots a deer from 200 feet away. He can rush up and hold the deer before it falls to the ground."
The third child said: My father is faster. He is a civil servant. He gets off work at 5 pm every day and gets home at 4:30.
