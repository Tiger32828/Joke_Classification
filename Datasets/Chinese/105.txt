One day in 1950, there was an international call from Japan to Taiwan.
Li: "Is it Pharaoh? I'm Li Wei." Wang: "Long time no see."
Li: "How are you doing?" Wang: "Very good, I miss you so much."
Li: "I have something to discuss with you." Wang: "What's the matter?"
Li: "I want to borrow 500,000 yuan from you." Wang: "What?"
Li: "I want to borrow 500,000 yuan from you." (louder) Wang: "What are you talking about? I can't hear you..."
Li: "I want to borrow 500,000 yuan from you." (shouting hoarsely) Wang: "Why can't you hear the strange phone?"
The receptionist said, "Mr. Wang, you can hear the phone clearly. He said that he wants to borrow 500,000 yuan from you. How can you say that you can't hear clearly?" Wang: "You can hear it clearly, then lend it to him!"
