"Dear Ladies and Gentlemen: Next, we will invite world-renowned artists who have won many times in international competitions to play us some wonderful pieces on the violin." The announcer said to the audience.
"But I'm not a violinist at all," the artist said embarrassedly to the wrongly introduced announcer. "I'm a pianist."
"Ladies and gentlemen," said the announcer, "unfortunately, the violinist forgot his violin at home, so he decided to play some piano pieces instead. This is a rare opportunity! Please give us a big round of applause. "
