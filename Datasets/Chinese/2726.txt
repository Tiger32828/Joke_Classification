A row of special forces camped on a cliff and continued their mission despite heavy bombardment by enemy planes.
When the platoon leader heard the sound of a bomb passing through the air nearby, he shouted, "Lie down!"
The bomb exploded just thirty feet from the platoon, and showers of shrapnel, rocks, and dust fell on the tent, and the sergeants got up, coughing and shaking.
At this time, the platoon leader remembered the training he had received in the military academy, and started to roll his name with a dim flashlight. As he read through the famous book, he heard them calmly answer in unison, "Yes, sir."
Then the platoon leader called out the last name, "Taylor." There was no answer.
The platoon leader, fearing the worst of the worst, raised his throat and shouted again, "Taylor!"
Someone in the dark replied, "That's the platoon leader himself! Sir!"
