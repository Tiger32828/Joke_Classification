Aaron, who lives in the suburbs, took a shortcut home and passed the cemetery at night.
It seemed that I heard the sound of knocking on the stone, although I was a little scared, but I still had to muster the courage to go forward.​​
As the knocking sounded closer, he became more and more frightened, thinking, "Who the hell is it?"
Finally, he saw that there was a person cutting a tombstone...

Aaron felt relieved, approached the man and said, "Dude, you really scared me, what are you doing so late?"
Only to hear the man replied angrily: "They engraved my name wrong."
