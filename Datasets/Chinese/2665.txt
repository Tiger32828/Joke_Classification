There was a Londoner and a Jew who had known each other for many years and now partnered to open a department store.
In their partnership agreement there is the following clause: "No matter who dies first, the undeceased must be placed in the coffin of the deceased at five thousand pounds, in preparation for entering the underworld, and there is no shortage of living expenses."
A year later, the Jew said to a friend, "My partner died last weekend. What a loss!"
His friend then asked him: "Did you put the five thousand pounds in the coffin of your London friend?"
So the Jew replied, "Of course I put him in the coffin, and it's still a cheque from HSBC, but it hasn't been cashed yet."
