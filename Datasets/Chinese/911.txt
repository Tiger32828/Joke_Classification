One day when my cousin was in high school, she asked my aunt to help her get her uniform to embroider.
What did my aunt forget to embroider the next day?
I called the school and asked my cousin.
My cousin was afraid that my aunt would make a phone call to spend money, so she said to my aunt, "Call me, Mom~".
As a result, my cousin was called to the discipline and punishment station the next day.
Because other people's uniforms are embroidered with names, only the cousin embroidered:

"Dalai Lama"
