Originally, British intelligence officers had no names, they only had code names, and the most powerful one was 007 with the code name No. 7—
Once, 007 went to China on a mission, and during his work, he fought with a beautiful Chinese female intelligence agent several times.
In the end, the female intelligence officer couldn't resist 007's charm, and the two finally united fiercely—
After some Wushan cloud and rain, the female intelligence agent said to 007 contentedly: "It's great! It's really great!"
007 didn't understand the meaning, thinking it was a nickname; after that, every time a beautiful woman asked his name——
He replied, "Bond! JamesBond!"
