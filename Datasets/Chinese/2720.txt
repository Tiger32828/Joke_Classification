The English gentleman was unable to go home in the rain, so he stayed at a friend's place, and suddenly the gentleman disappeared.
Half an hour later, when he came back in the rain, his friend asked him out of curiosity, and replied, "I went home specifically to tell my wife that I won't go home because of the rain tonight."
