Ah Zong and his girlfriend, Ah Ling, who had just met, were "running errands" in the back seat of the car.
"Damn it!" A Zong said, "If I had known that you were a virgin, I would have spent more time on errands."
"Yeah!" A Ling said, "If you weren't in a hurry, I would take off the stockings first."
