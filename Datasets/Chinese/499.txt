There is a British boy who participated in the mainland "If You Are the One" (Marriage) program.

The woman asked: Are you an only child?
Male: There is also a brother who is married. (counting lights off)

The woman asked again: Do you have a room? Who do you live with after marriage?
Male: An old house from the last century, living with grandma, father, stepmother, brother, and sister-in-law. (counting lights off)

The woman asked again: What is your job?
Male: Soldiers. (last light left)

The last woman asked: Do you have a BMW and Mercedes-Benz as a limousine when you get married?
Re: My grandmother definitely disagrees, and generally uses a horse-drawn carriage.
The girl snorted and said: I would rather cry on the BMW than smile on the carriage. (all lights off)

The British lad left the scene in tears.

The next day, the front page headline of the British "The Times" read:
Prince Harry, a member of my royal family, was eliminated in the first round on a Chinese TV dating show.
