Patrol officers caught a man stealing lobster on the beach,
He also accused him of catching lobsters without approval and violating the Fishing and Hunting Law, requiring a fine.

Man: "What do you mean? I'm not breaking the law, these two lobsters are my pets, I just took them out for a walk!"
Patrolman: "What nonsense!"
Man: "It's true! They love to dive into the sea for a swim, but as soon as I whistle, they come back to me!"
Patrolman: "I'll take a look at this~"

So the man threw two lobsters into the waves.
Patrolman: "Okay, listen to how you whistle to bring your pet lobster back..."
The man asked back, "Lobster? What lobster?"
Patrolman: "..."
