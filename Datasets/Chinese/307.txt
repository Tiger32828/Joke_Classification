The boss of a certain company went to the temple to ask for a peace sign.
The abbot took out a stack of talismans and burned them, saying:
"I burned seven, seven and forty-nine talismans for you. Each talisman is 1,000 yuan, and the sale is 40,000 yuan. You can't bargain for the Bodhisattva. You can swipe your card if you don't bring cash. Amitabha!"
After all, I ordered a little monk to wait for the card machine to be swiped.
The big boss took out a check without hesitation, and filled it out with 40,000 yuan reverently.
I lit it with a lighter and said, "Master, the Bodhisattva can receive it in just one working day. Good job! Good job!"
The abbot burst into tears and sighed in the sky: "When it comes to cheating money, who can deceive entrepreneurs in Taiwan? A sin is a sin!"
The big boss put his hands together: "You are welcome! Please remember that there are people outside people, and there are days outside the sky!"
