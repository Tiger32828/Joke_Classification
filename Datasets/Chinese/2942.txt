A guest saw that the host served him with cabbage and green vegetables, so he asked the host for a pair of glasses, saying that his eyesight was not good. After putting on the glasses, he thanked the host and praised the host for spending too much money on cooking so many dishes.
The host said, "There's no food. How can you say it's too expensive?"
The guest said, "The table is full, why don't you say no?"
The host said, "Where is the food?"
The customer pointed to the inside of the plate and said, "This is not a vegetable, could it be meat?"
