The young man asked the Zen master, "Master, can you laugh at life by sitting on the geometry of meditation?"
The Zen master suddenly slapped the young man to the ground and handed him a cold medicine.
After eating, the young man had an epiphany and said, "Master, are you saying that my cultivation of meditation is still very weak. Should I use meditation to improve myself at any time in my life?"
The Zen master shook his head and said, "You took the wrong medicine."
