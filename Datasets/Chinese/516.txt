A mansion was broken into by thieves, who tied up the hostess.
The thief pointed at the host with a knife and said, hurry up and give me the jewelry and money,
As a result, the host said, "It doesn't matter, you can take anything in the house, but I beg you, please untie this woman quickly and let her go!"
The thief said, "Wow! It's not easy, you really love your wife!"

The host said, "No, this is the next-door neighbor's wife, and my wife is coming back soon!"
