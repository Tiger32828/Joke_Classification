Xiao Ming: "I had a dream yesterday, it was very wonderful." Xiao Hong: "What kind of dream? Let's hear it."
Xiao Ming: "You are the hero in your dream!" Xiao Hong: "Really? Am I a handsome prince charming?"
Xiao Ming: "No! I dreamed that you were chasing a pig out of breath with a kitchen knife in your hand." Xiao Hong: "Am I chasing a pig?"
Xiao Ming: "Yeah! You were running sweaty, and as a result, the pig ran into a dead alley." Xiao Hong: "And then what?"
Xiao Ming: "The pig suddenly knelt down and begged for mercy, saying, 'It was born from the same root, so why is it too urgent to fry each other'."
