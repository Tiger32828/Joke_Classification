Xiao Ming has always been known for his eloquence and quick response. No one has ever been able to take advantage of Xiao Ming verbally, but Xiao Wang always does not believe in evil, and still likes to find every opportunity to tease Xiao Ming to prove his strength is above Xiao Ming.
One day Xiao Wang served as the host of the party, and it happened that Xiao Ming had another talk show performance.
Seeing the opportunity, Xiao Wang introduced Xiao Ming and said, "The next one is my classmate who is performing a talk show. He is known as a prodigy. In fact, he is nothing special. He just eats with one mouth."
Hearing the words, Xiao Ming still came to the stage with a smile on his face: "Dear guests, I am truly ashamed of the genius of the world. Our host is a real genius that is rare to see in a century, because he does not rely on his mouth to eat."
