There was a young lady who suddenly stopped in the middle of the road when she was halfway through the car, and couldn't even start.
The traffic policeman standing by the side watched her for a long time, watching the red light turn green, and the green light turned red...
The lady still stopped in the middle of the road, not moving.
So the traffic police couldn't help but walked over and asked the lady, "What's the matter, don't you have a color you like?"
