A Chinese gentleman arrives at Miami Beach for vacation during peak season and hears that he has no room to stay.
"There must be a room, there will always be a room," said the Chinese gentleman.
"No," said the clerk at the counter.
"Look!" said the Chinese gentleman, "if you heard that President Johnson was coming, you would find a room, wouldn't you?"
"Yes, for President Jensen," the clerk said.
"Okay, the president won't be coming," the man said, "let me stay in his room."
