Lao Jiu spent a day in Hanzhong, and was so tired that he stayed overnight in a hotel. The bed had bed bugs, and it was hard to sleep.
Lao Jiu was furious when he heard someone shouting outside: "Selling bed bug medicine, selling bed bug medicine one by one - once you use it, it will work - once you use it, it will work!"
The old ninth was overjoyed, flew out of the house, bought a few packs of medicine and went back to the house, spread it all over the bed, and went back to bed for sleep.
Not long after, I heard the former call again: "Selling bed bug medicine, selling bed bug medicine one by one, it's good to use it - it's good to use it!"
Lao Jiu was angry and blamed him: "Why is it not working?" The dealer said in surprise, "I don't know where the customer service is used?"
Lao Jiu said, "How do you use it?" The salesman said, "Catch bed bugs, put them in the mouth of the medicine, and the bugs will die immediately."
