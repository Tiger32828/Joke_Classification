A lady who is not very good in Taiwanese is doing market research by telephone for the first time.

She made the first call: "Hello?..." "Hello... I'm doing market research, can I delay you for a few minutes?"
It was the voice of an old woman: "Mili for the blind secret?? I listened to it...for the Taiwanese!"
The young lady just wanted to ask her grandma in Taiwanese if she was alone: ​​"Gan, your mother?" The young lady asked in Taiwanese with other legs (you are the only one)
Unexpectedly, the grandmother replied, "Let the back!" Then she cut it off angrily.

Leaving us laughing and the dazed lady XD
