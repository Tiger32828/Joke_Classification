An exhibition of modern portraits is taking place in the exhibition hall.
In front of a work, a noble lady pretended to be an expert and commented: "How can such a painting still be exhibited here! Look at this model, the body is like a bucket, the face is as white as a dead person, and the lips are painted as if they had just eaten. A live mouse..."
The husband next to her quickly grabbed her and whispered, "Come here! My dear, this is not a portrait, this is a mirror."
