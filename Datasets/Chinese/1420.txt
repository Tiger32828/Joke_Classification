We went to Thailand for a graduation trip a while ago. The sun in Thailand is too poisonous. Everyone smeared sunscreen on the car and applied several layers.
Xiaohong asked me, "ã„Ÿ, help me to see if there are any clouds?" Although I was puzzled, I still lifted the curtains to help her see if there were any "clouds" in the sky outside.
Then he answered her: "Yes, but not much." When I turned around and saw the exaggerated vermicelli on her face, I realized that she wanted me to help her see if there was "evenness"?
