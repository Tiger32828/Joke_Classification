Liu Luoguo rode his beloved donkey to the city. His good friend drove by and asked him to sit in the car. The donkey followed behind.
The car was thirty yards and the donkey followed closely.
When the car was 50 yards away, the friend asked worriedly, "I'm afraid your bass is dead. Its tongue is sticking out."
"Which way?"
"left."
"Keep the steering wheel steady, it's about to overtake."
