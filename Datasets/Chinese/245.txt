Kong Ming rides a donkey into the city and meets Zhou Yu!
Zhou Yu asked, "Have you eaten yet?"
Kong Ming said, "Thank you, I have already eaten!"
Zhou Yu said proudly, "I asked the donkey, what are you saying!"
Kong Ming turned around and slapped the donkey twice, scolding, "If there are relatives in the city, don't say a word."
