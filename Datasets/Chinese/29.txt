Before the physical examination, the company issued a consultation form for everyone to choose the physical examination items, and employees can put forward personal special requirements in the remarks column.
A female colleague wrote in the remarks column: "Gynecological examinations are limited to female doctors."
What is puzzling is that many of the employees who filled out the form after her, regardless of gender, filled in the words "female doctors only".
What's even more surprising is that someone wrote in the remarks column: "Only unmarried female doctors under the age of 25 with a bachelor's degree or above."
