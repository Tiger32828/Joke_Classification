There is a man in the town who loves to take advantage. No matter what other people have, as long as he sees it, he will find a way to take advantage.
People who know his conduct will avoid his house as long as they have objects in their hands.
One day, someone walked past the door of his house with a piece of sand and thought, "He can't take advantage of this thing!"
Unexpectedly, he was dragged to the house, took out a kitchen knife from the kitchen, sharpened it on the gravel a few times, then pushed him away and said, "Okay, you can go."
