Once, my classmate and I were playing dodgeball, and my classmate threw a fastball into my thigh,
I reached out to take it, but I didn't get it, but I opened the zipper of the "reservoir".
Amid the laughter of my classmates, I ran back to the classroom in shame. When I was about to sit back in my seat, a hand suddenly stretched out beside me and said, "Why do you sit in my seat?"
Looking back, it was an unfamiliar face. what! I actually went to the wrong classroom!
I rushed outside and saw my classmates rolling on the ground with laughter. I was so embarrassed that I was sweating like rain.
When I got back to the classroom and picked up my towel to wipe my face, I suddenly smelled a stench......
A closer look, it turned out to be a rag! Ugh! Really embarrassed!
