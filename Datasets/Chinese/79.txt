Before the old man dies, he divides the inheritance to his son.

He said to his eldest son, "Your daughter-in-law is about to give birth to a child, so I'll leave the bankbook to you."

Said to the second son: "You are going to get married soon, I will leave the house to you"

Finally, he said to his younger son, "I worry about you the most. I don't have a girlfriend yet, so I will leave the most precious inheritance to you."

The little son was delighted,

The old man said, "I want to give you Line's account. There are more than 100 young girls in the friend column."
