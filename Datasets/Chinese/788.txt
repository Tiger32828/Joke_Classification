There is an uncle who eats pot roast pasta every day without pepper
this day
He passed by on a motorcycle and shouted across the street
I want a bowl of pot roast pasta!
The proprietress then shouted back
Boil a pot without pepper
suddenly

A loud voice shouted from across the street
"I'm normal today!"
