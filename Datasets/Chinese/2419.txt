Xiao Ming was drinking with his friends, but got drunk and called a taxi home.
On the way, I asked the driver, "What's wrong with me, I can't control my lower body when I drink too much?"
The driver gave a wretched smile and said, "I understand you, everyone is a man! It's normal to have a little bit of alcohol to get into the wrong place. It's normal."
Xiao Ming said vaguely, "No... No, I... pissed on your car."
