Ming Dynasty Hanlin Chen Quan has always been humorous.
Once, he entered the forbidden palace by mistake and was captured by Zhonggui,
Chen Quan said: "Little man Chen Quan, accidentally entered the jail by mistake, please openly and kindly."
Zhong Gui said, "I've heard for a long time that you are good at telling jokes. Today, if you say a word, if it makes me laugh, I will let you go, otherwise I will be executed."
Chen Quan thought about it and said, "Fuck."
Zhong Gui asked, "How do you say it?"
Chen Quan replied, "It's up to the father-in-law to let go, and it's up to the father-in-law not to let it go."
Zhonggui couldn't stop laughing and released him.
