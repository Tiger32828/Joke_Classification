The director's favorite female secretary, who did nothing wrong in her work, was fired by the director.

A friend asked why?
The director said, "On my birthday a few days ago, she invited me to her house, and even told me that her husband was on a business trip.
After entering the door, she asked me to stay in the living room and told me to go into the bedroom after five minutes, and then she went into the bedroom very mysteriously. "
The friend asked eagerly, "Then what?"
The director said angrily: "After I pushed through the bedroom door, I was shocked and fainted. All my colleagues in the unit crowded into the bedroom, lighting candles and singing Happy Birthday in unison."
The friend asked suspiciously, "What's that?"

"X! I got naked in!"
