A priest walks into a certain restaurant, looks with disgust at the group of informal characters, and sits alone in a chair.
The maid ran over and asked, "Would you like a cup of tea?"
"No tea," he growled.
"What about coffee? Bishop." "No coffee!"
Another wise maid whispered in his ear, "How about whiskey and soda, Father?"
The priest's face brightened and said, "Okay, but no water."
