One day my father gave his son a pair of chopsticks and asked him to break it
The son broke
"It's easy to do," said the son.
Then the father took out three chopsticks for his son to break
The son broke as soon as he broke it: "It's easy to do."
Then the father took out thirty chopsticks for his son to break
The son still broke after a break: "Dad, what are you doing?"



"It's okay, I'll ask."
