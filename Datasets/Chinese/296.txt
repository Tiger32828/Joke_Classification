One day, while I was burying my head in the newspaper,
My wife suddenly said that I should go get a pair of glasses.
Computer and TV every day, these eyes are really a bit myopic,
It seems that my wife is becoming more and more considerate to me.
Thinking of it, a warm current came to my heart.
I said, "Go to the optical shop tomorrow and check your eye chart when you're free."

The wife immediately said, "I can test my eyesight now."
She pointed to the corner of the door and asked, "What did you see?"
I replied, "A plastic bag."
"what colour?"
"Red."
"What's the use?"
"It's for garbage."
"Empty or full?"
"full."
"Your eyesight is very good, but every time you go out, you pass this full garbage bag, but you always turn a blind eye. I thought you were short-sighted!"
