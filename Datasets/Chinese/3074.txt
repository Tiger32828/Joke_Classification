A lion fell deeply in love with a woodcutter's daughter. The girl's father said, "Your teeth are too long."
The lion went to the dentist to have his teeth pulled out. When it came back, he asked the woodcutter to kiss him again, and the woodcutter said, "Not yet, your claws are too long."
The lion went to the doctor again, pulled out his claws, and came back to ask the girl to marry him.
When the woodcutter saw that the lion was disarmed, he opened its head.
