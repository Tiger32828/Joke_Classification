Early in the morning, I took a colleague's car to the company. When I was waiting for the red light, a Porsche was parked next to me. She was a beautiful woman. She lowered the window and took a look. My colleague said confidently, "It must be a mistress!"
Maybe the voice was a little loud, and the beauty heard it and looked a little unhappy.
When the light just got green, we ran away, only to see Porsche catch up with the accelerator, lowered the window, and shouted at us, "Have you ever seen a mistress working so early!"
