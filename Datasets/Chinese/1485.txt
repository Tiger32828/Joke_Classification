A little boy came home from school and saw a woman lying on the bed from the window, rubbing her chest and shouting, "I want a man, I want a man!"
The next day the little boy walked past the window and found a man lying on top of the woman.
So the little boy went home and lay on the bed, rubbing his chest and shouting, "I want a bicycle, I want a bicycle!"
