A scientist and a poet ride on the same train, they don't know each other. The scientist said to the poet, "Would you like to play a game?"
The poet looked at the scientist, but did not answer. The scientist continued: "We ask each other questions, and if we can't answer, we will give 5 yuan, how about that?"
The poet wanted to say that it might not be easy to beat scientists, so he declined. The scientist still didn't give up and said, "That's it, if I can't answer it, I'll give you 50 yuan. Is that all right?"
Under the temptation of money, the poet agreed to him. The scientist asked, "How far is the distance from the earth to the moon?"
The poet could not answer, so he directly gave the scientist 5 yuan. Then the poet asked, "What has four legs when it goes up a mountain, and five legs when it goes down?"
The scientist looked at the poet suspiciously, took out a few pieces of paper, and began to calculate on it. When the train arrived at the station, he still couldn't figure out what the answer was.
So he took 50 yuan to the poet. The scientist asked, "Is that the answer? Tell me." The poet was silent, gave him 5 yuan, and left.
