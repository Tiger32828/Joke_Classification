There was a university philosophy graduate. When he returned home, his father killed chickens and bought wine to entertain him. During dinner, the father asked his son, "What did you study in college?"
"philosophy."
"What's the use of learning this?"
The son said: "After studying philosophy, I look at problems differently from others. For example, let's take this chicken on our table for example!
To ordinary people, it looks like a chicken, a specific chicken. But in the eyes of those of us who have studied philosophy, there are two chickens, and in addition to a concrete chicken, there is an abstract chicken. "
My sister, who had been listening to their conversation, suddenly interrupted and said, "Okay, my dad and I will eat this concrete chicken, and you can eat that abstract chicken alone!"
