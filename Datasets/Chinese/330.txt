Woman: Master, why did my husband cheat?
Master: You eat this cake first.
Woman: Hmm.
Zen Master: Is it delicious?
Woman: Delicious.
Zen Master: Do you still want to eat?
Woman: Think.
Zen Master: Now do you know why your husband cheated?
Woman: I get it, because I'm insatiable and never know how to be satisfied.

The Zen master opened his eyes wide and said: You don't understand because you are too fat.
