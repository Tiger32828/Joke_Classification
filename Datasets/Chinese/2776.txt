A poor man was suffering from diarrhea, and when he asked Jia Huatuo to treat him, he said, "The family is poor, and I can't pay for the medicine. After the treatment is healed, please have a drink."
Jia Huatuo agreed, and the poor man was cured by taking medicine. He was afraid that the doctor would ask for thanks and pretend that the diarrhea would not stop.
One day Jia Huatuo saw his stool, and he checked it out. Seeing what he explained, he couldn't help but get angry, "It's so easy to explain, why don't you invite me?!"
