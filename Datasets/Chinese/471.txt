Xiao Ming was fighting at school, and the teacher told him to invite his parents to school tomorrow.

After school, Xiao Ming went to the park with confidence and paid 500 yuan to hire an old man who was playing chess.

The next day, the teacher saw Xiao Ming and the old man and asked, "Xiao Ming, who is this...?"
Xiao Ming said, "He's my dad."

The teacher quickly asked Xiao Ming to stand outside the office first.
Then he asked the old man in a soft voice, "Dad! You have such a big child outside, does Mom know?"
