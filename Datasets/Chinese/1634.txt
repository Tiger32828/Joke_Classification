Today, my colleague's father-in-law passed away, and we went to offer our condolences.
A late buddy came in with his cheeks covered and said angrily, "Toothache, I just got out of the hospital and took a taxi here. After getting in the car, I couldn't stand the pain, so I lay in the back seat and told the driver to go. crematorium."
The wicked driver said to me, "Brother, why don't you go to another hospital?"
