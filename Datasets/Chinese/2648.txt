One morning, my brother swallowed a fishbone because he was eating fish carelessly.
The next morning, the younger brother touched the bone in his chest and ran to tell Dad, "I seem to have one more bone than others."
Dad said "Why?"
The younger brother said, "Because I ate a fishbone yesterday morning, I felt like there was a bone in my chest this morning!"
