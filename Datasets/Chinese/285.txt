One day, a lady went to buy meatballs.
Miss: "Boss, I want two children to take away!"
Since the business was good, after a while, the boss was afraid that he might make mistakes,
So he asked, "Miss, are your two small ones?"
The lady blushed and replied, "Boss, your two capsules are the small ones."
