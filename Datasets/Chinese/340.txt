Recently, I also found time to visit the old Zen master you mentioned every day.
That day he brought a bowl of millet porridge, and after shaking it for a while, the porridge became cloudy. Then he put the porridge on the table, gradually the rice grains sank, and the porridge became clearer.
I suddenly realized: I understand, I can see life clearly when I calm down!
The old Zen master said: No, the porridge is cold, you can drink it!
