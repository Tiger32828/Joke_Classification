Son: "Dad, come and scare me by pretending to be a ghost."
Father: "Alright! Alright!"
Son: "Dad, you lied and didn't pretend to be a ghost to scare me?"
Father: "Dad is already pretending to be a ghost."
Son: "How can you be lying on the bed without moving, how can you be pretending to be a ghost?"
Father: "Dad pretends to be a lazy person."
