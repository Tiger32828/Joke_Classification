"Hey! I want to talk to you about my wife. She has been having a weird idea lately that she wants to be a liar in order to better understand the psychology of men..." a man said on the phone.
"Sir, you made the wrong call. You should have consulted a psychiatrist, and we are an investment advisory firm here."
The man said, "That's right! I didn't find the wrong person. What I want to ask is how to invest the money my wife earned as a liuying ying."
