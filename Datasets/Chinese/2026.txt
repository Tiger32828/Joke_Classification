Xiao Lin was in a drunken car accident. After arriving at the hospital, the nurse's testimony was contaminated with blood, and she could only distinguish the surname "Lin".
So the nurse asked Xiao Lin in Taiwanese, "What do you mean by "Lin"?"
Xiaolin: "I'm "Lin" Shaoxing."
Miss: "No, I'm asking what's your name?"
Xiaolin: "My name is "Dried Tofu" with "Braised Egg"."
Seeing poor communication, the lady should focus on medical care, so she gave up the inquiry.
He took two cups to Xiaolin and said, "The big one is for stool, and the small one is for urine. The toilet is at the end of the corridor."

Xiaolin took the cup and left. He didn't come back after half an hour. The nurse noticed that the situation was abnormal. She wondered if Xiaolin would faint due to excessive blood loss, and immediately rushed to the toilet to check.
As soon as she entered the toilet, the nurse saw that Xiao Lin was worrying in the toilet safe and sound, and a big stone in her heart was immediately put down.
But he couldn't help but ask a question like a complaint: "Why did you stay in the toilet for more than half an hour and didn't come out."
Xiao Lin's answer was: "Miss, I can barely swallow this urine, but I really can't swallow this stool."
