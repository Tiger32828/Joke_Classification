The day before yesterday, I took 245 back to Banqiao with my classmates,
And in the first fraternity seat in front there is an old man,
This old Arbor gets up every time the car stops!
This has been repeated from Taipei Main Station to Wanhua.
Xiao Ming: If you can't stand it, ask the old man
Xiao Ming: Abo, why do you stand up every time the car stops?
Aber: Every time the car stops, the display panel above the driver will display "Stop the car", so I have to stop every time the car stops!
Xiao Ming: Please! Abor, it's "stop at the next stop", not "stop for a while"
