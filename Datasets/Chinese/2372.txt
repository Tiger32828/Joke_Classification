Lao Zhang has been married for 20 years, and recently decided to divorce his wife, because when his wife gets angry, she will throw him a plate.

His friends advised him:

"It's been so many years, so why do you need a divorce now?"

The old man said helplessly:

"I can't take it anymore, because the more she throws the plate, the more accurate it is!"
