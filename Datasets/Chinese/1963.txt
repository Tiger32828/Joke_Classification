An old gentleman was hit by a taxi driver while walking on the road, so the two quarreled on the side of the road...
Driver: "My driving skills are top-notch, it's not my fault, and I have ten years of driving experience."
Old gentleman: "Really? I've been walking for fifty years, and this is the first time I've been hit!"
