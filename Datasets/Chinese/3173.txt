I rarely buy lemon juice for my kids because I don't know what to drink.
But I met a young hawker with clean face and hands,
Thinking that his lemon juice must be clean too, he bought a glass.
He told me the business was booming, and I told me he wanted to put the money away.
"No one can guess where my money is," he said.
I can't guess, and I didn't know his secret until I paid for it.
He reached into the big bottle of lemon juice and pulled out some money for meâ€”a few wet changes.
