On the road in North Africa, foreign tourists saw an Arab man riding safely on the back of a donkey, but let his wife walk behind with a large amount of fine grass on his back.
The tourist is not pleasing to the eye, saying that he should not abuse his wife.
Unexpectedly, the Arab woman helped her husband and asked the tourist: "My husband is so tired at night, do your women like it?"
