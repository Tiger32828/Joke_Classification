There is a parrot hanging in front of the pet store.
A fat woman passed by and looked at it, and the parrot said, "You are so fat."
The woman ignored it and went away.
The next day the woman passed by on purpose, and the parrot said, "You are really fat."
The woman was very angry and went to the shop owner, who promised that it would not happen in the future.
On the third day the woman passed by again, and the parrot looked at the woman and said:
"What am I going to say, you know!"
