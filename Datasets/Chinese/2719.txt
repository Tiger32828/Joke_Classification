The North Pole needs many paratroopers. In a paratrooper recruitment campaign, the French army posted a propaganda advertisement on a busy Parisian avenue, and achieved remarkable results!
The post reads: "Youth! Join the French paratrooper battalion! Crossing this road is more dangerous than skydiving!"
It's a pity that the magic of this ad was ruined by a line of scribbled words below.
The line read: "I'd love to participate, but the solicitation office is across the road!"
