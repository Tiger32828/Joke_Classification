There is a billionaire with a successful career, who is not only in the wind, but also very feminine.
But he's got a problem with migraines...
Every time it hurts... I call him life is better than death...
No matter how many top brain doctors I have seen, it has not been cured, and it is getting worse.

One day, the billionaire had a full-body health check.
Finally found the reason....
The urologist at the hospital told him:
"You're a genital disease, with a migraine caused by affecting the nerves.
If you don't treat it sooner, you will probably die from migraines!
And there's only one way to cure it, and that's... cut it out..."

The rich man thought for a long time...
If there is no life, what do you want the bird to do?
So I had surgery!

A month later, the rich man's wound was healed, and so was his migraine.
He goes shopping like a newborn...
I went to the men's underwear store, so I said to the sales lady, "Miss, give me 1 dozen panties in size S."
The lady looked at him and said kindly, "Sir, looking at your figure, it should be an XL size."
The rich man smiled and said, "I always wear size S..."
The lady continued, "Sir, wearing panties that are too small can cause migraines, but changing to XL will be no problem..."
