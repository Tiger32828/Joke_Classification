There are three brothers, the eldest is nicknamed Rogue, the second is Trouble, and the third is Machine Gun.
One day, the second child was caught in the police station for doing bad things, so the boss took the third child to the police station to protect the second child. When he arrived at the police station, he said, "I'm a hooligan, I brought a machine gun to ask for trouble."
