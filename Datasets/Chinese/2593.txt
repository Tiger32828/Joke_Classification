There is a father, worried that his daughter who is about to marry will be bullied by her husband, on her daughter's wedding night,
He instructed his daughter: "If you feel pain during sex, call your father immediately; if you feel good, sing Orchid Grass."
On the night of the bridal chamber, my father leaned nervously by the door and listened carefully.
As a result, he heard: "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy............"
Listening carefully, her daughter is humming to the tune of orchid grass.
