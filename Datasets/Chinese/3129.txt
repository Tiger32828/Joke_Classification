Pope John XXIII was a cheerful and diligent man who, despite his respect and adoration, often made fun of himself.
Shortly after his inauguration, he exclaimed to himself:
"I must tell the Pope about this - but I am the Pope! I had to ask God."
The crowd went to see the pope, and the police drove them back. he asked:
"Why?" The policeman replied, "It's a security measure." He said, "Security? I won't hurt them."
