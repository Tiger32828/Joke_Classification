A man went to the library to borrow books, and he asked the female library staff:
"Excuse me, where is the book "The Happy Life of Marriage"?"
"It's a fantasy novel, go to the third row of cabinets on the right to find it."
"Then where is the book "The Way of Getting Along with Husband and Wife"?"
"It's a martial arts novel, look for it in the first row of cabinets on the left!"
