One day, when Xiao Ming climbed the neighbor's fruit tree to steal fruit, he was caught by the neighbor.
Neighbor: "You bad boy, you acted as a thief at a young age, but when you grow up, come down and take me to see your father!"
So Xiao Ming shouted to the other tree, "Dad! Someone is looking for you."
