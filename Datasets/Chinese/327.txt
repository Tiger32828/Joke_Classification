Ya Cai asked a Taoist priest to transcend the soul of his father who had just passed away, and the Taoist priest offered $1000.
After haggling, it was sold for $800. When doing things, the Taoist priest said: "Please go to the East Heaven! Go to the East Heaven."
Acai asked, "Why didn't you go to the west?"
The Taoist replied, "Only $1000 can go to the Western Heaven."
Ya Cai only promised to pay $1000. At this time, Ya Cai heard his father's scolding from the coffin:
"Unfilial son, for the mere $200, make me run around."
