two students arguing
A said, "You...you can call me again, and I can find someone with a phone call!"
B said: "You.... you fight! I don't believe it..."
Then A really ran to make a phone call, and when he came back, he put a harsh sentence:
"You'll know how to die in 30 minutes!!!"

At this time, B was very nervous, but there was nothing he could do.
30 minutes later, the school broadcast: "Student B, you have a visitor, please come to the Academic Affairs Office."

"Wow!" Although B was very scared, thinking that he was in the Academic Affairs Office, he should be fine.

So he went to the Academic Affairs Office,
A teenager with dyed blond hair walked up to him: "Are you Y XX?"
B: "I am..."
"Sorry for the long wait, this is the 10 Hawaiian pizzas you ordered with bombing chicken, a total of 6,700 yuan?"
