Alice works as a receptionist in a company; she has to deal with visitors, phone calls, colleagues and bosses, and has to type when she's in the space.
Sometimes some self-righteous people call and often give her a difficult question: "I want to talk to your boss."
"Can I tell him who's calling?"
"Get me your boss, I'm going to talk to him right now."
"Sorry. It seems silly that he paid me to answer the phone. Because nine out of ten calls are for him."
