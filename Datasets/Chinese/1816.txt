During the summer vacation, I took my five-year-old son to Taiwan on a tour.
On the train one day, he asked me, "Mommy, what kind of flower is that?" Looking at the flower he didn't recognize, he could only answer: "It's a wild flower."
Then the mother and son began to play "Wild Grass", "Wild Dog", "Bison" and other road conditions reports.
Suddenly a young girl passed by, and the son immediately said aloud: "Mummy, she's a wild woman!"
