In 1945, cartoonist Liao Bingxiong exhibited the cartoon "Cat Country Spring and Autumn" in Chongqing.
Tian Haiyan of People Magazine invited Guo Moruo, Song Yunbin, Wang Qi, and Brother Liao Bing to dinner.
During the banquet, Mr. Guo asked Brother Liao Bing, "Why is your name so strange, calling yourself a brother?"
Printmaker Wang Qi explained on his behalf: "His sister's name is Bing, so she uses that name."
After listening to Mr. Guo, he smiled and said, "Ah, now I understand, Yu Dafu's wife must be named Yu Da, and Shao Lizi's father must be Shao Li."
