Lao Ming saw that the red dust had entered the temple to study Zen, and he went to the Zen master to tell the Zen master, Master, lend me some money!
The Zen master replied, "I have to discuss this matter with my wife."
Lao Ming said in surprise, "Don't you have a wife?"
The Zen master said, "So there is no discussion."
