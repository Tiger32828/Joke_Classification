Both Xiao Rui and Xiao Xuan received the summoning order on the same day, and neither of them wanted to do military service.
Xiao Rui once heard that people without teeth were not accepted in the army, so both of them had all their teeth pulled out.
On the day of the medical examination, the two of them were in the same line, but there was a big, hairy, smelly truck driver stuck between them.
When Xiaoxuan got to the front of the line, he told the doctor who examined him that he had no teeth. The doctor asked him to open his mouth, then circled his gums with his index finger and said, "Yes, you don't have teeth. , don't be a soldier!"
Then it was the truck driver's turn, and the medical officer said, "What's wrong with you?"
The truck driver said, "I have severe super hemorrhoids."
The medical officer told the driver to bend over, and after carefully turning his index finger around the anus, he said, "Yes, your condition is serious and unqualified!"
Then it was Xiao Rui's turn, and the doctor asked again, "Then what's your problem?"
Xiao Rui stared at the doctor's index finger and sighed and replied, "No problem, I have no problem at all."
