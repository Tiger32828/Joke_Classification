(To you who are writing a plan)

A child is writing an essay on the topic: My Family. The content contains a paragraph that mentions:
"It's late at night, mom is playing mahjong, dad is surfing the Internet..."
Dad saw it and was dissatisfied with the child's writing, so he pointed to the child and said, "The composition should be well written. Although the content is drawn from life, the connotation should be realistic!"
The child immediately changed it to: "It's late at night, my mother is gambling, and my father is dating online..."
Dad was even more dissatisfied, and said, "You need to be positive, sunny, and positive! Go and see what people's official TV stations and official newspapers say about it!"
The child understands at one point, and changes to: "It's late at night, my mother is studying the economy, and my father is studying the Internet + life..."
Although the father who works in academia praised his child's progress, he still felt that it was not enough, so he enlightened his child and said that if he grew up and wanted to work in academia like his father, he would need to be able to apply for state-subsidized scientific research projects or something. Write this: "Mom is studying the dynamic zero-sum game under the state of information asymmetry, and Dad is studying the emerging combination of artificial intelligence and emotional supply side."
Then the father said to his son whose eyes were shining with wisdom,
If you plan to apply for key research and development projects of the National Science Foundation, it is not enough to write, you must use the most popular theories in the current academic circles and write:
"Mother is studying the new "Prisoner's Dilemma" game under the condition of multi-factor interference information asymmetry in complex groups;
Dad is studying the innovative algorithm and practice of the six-dimensional space theory in emotional supply-side matching from the perspective of big data. "
