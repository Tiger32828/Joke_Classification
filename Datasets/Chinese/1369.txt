A student A was listening to a concert with the teacher,
A girl came on stage, and that girl performed a solo,
Jia couldn't help complaining, "That girl can sing so badly!"
The teacher said, "That's my daughter."
When X heard it, he hurriedly said, "I mean the arrangement and lyrics are terrible!"
The teacher said, "I am in charge of arranging and writing lyrics."
