Once upon a time, a Japanese came to Taiwan to learn Chinese. More than ten years later, he not only can speak Chinese,
He can also speak Taiwanese Hakka, and there is no accent at all.
"No one knows I'm Japanese now!" he thought to himself.

One day, he traveled to a small fish port in Kaohsiung and saw an Arbo who was kissing larvae, so on a whim, he greeted the Arbor in Taiwanese and asked, "Arbor! You are willing to know Where am I from?" Aberzai replied, "I can't tell from your accent."
The Japanese was heartbroken: "I can't believe that my Taiwanese language has improved so much."
At this time, Aberzai suddenly said, "If you can count all the snails you caught in Taiwanese, I will have a way to know where you are from."
So the Japanese started counting with a fairly correct and very Taiwanese pronunciation: "One, two, three, four, five...fifty-seven....one hundred and two..."
After more than an hour, he replied: "Nine thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven snails! Abozai, I don't think you can guess where I am!!"


Aberzai replied, "You are Japanese, Taiwanese are not so stupid!"
