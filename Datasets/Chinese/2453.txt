Cards are not allowed while the U.S. military is on duty. But after dark the three veterans—a Catholic, a Protestant, and a Jew—play secretly. As a result, the ammunition was lost and the accused was sent to the command.
Catholics say: "I swear to the Virgin Mary, I didn't play cards!"
Protestants also swore to Martin Luther that he didn't play either.
Finally it was the Jew's turn. He couldn't remember who to swear to, so he had an idea and said, "General, can I play cards alone?"
