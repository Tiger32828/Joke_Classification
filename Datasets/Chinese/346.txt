The young man asked the Zen master, "How can I end being single?"
The Zen master lightly pointed to a mountain opposite,
The young man said thoughtfully, "The Zen master means that there is another master on the opposite mountain who can answer me?"
The Zen master said, "I came to be a Zen master when no one wanted me. You still come to ask me? There are still vacancies on the opposite mountain, so you should go to become a Zen master as soon as possible."
