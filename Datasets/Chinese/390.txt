Mother educates her daughter: choosing a husband is a lifetime event, and you should use more snacks!
Look at your dad, he can repair everything, such as mobile phones, computers, cars, electrical appliances, shoes, clothes, bags, and even a broken wardrobe.
The daughter interrupted her mother and said: I understand.
Mom said angrily, "You know shit, if you find a husband like your dad, you won't want to use new things for the rest of your life."
