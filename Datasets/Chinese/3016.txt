There is a person who likes orangutans very much, and went to the zoo to see orangutans on a whim one day.
When he saw the orangutan, he excitedly waved to the orangutan, but the orangutan angrily took the stone on the ground and threw it at him.
He was smashed to the ground, and was very angry to ask the administrator to reason.
"Did you do something to them?" The manager asked in confusion. He said he just waved to them.
The manager replied, "That's right! Let me tell you, in the language of the gorilla, waving means an idiot."
"Oh! That's it. So how am I going to greet them?"
The manager replied, "You have to beat your chest and shout at them."
He immediately ran up to the orangutans to beat his chest and shout at them.
As a result, he saw all the orangutans waving at him.
