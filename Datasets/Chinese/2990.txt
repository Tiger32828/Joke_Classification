Mr. Wilson decided to do a little experiment to see what his son would become when he grew up.
He put three things on the table: a 10-dollar bill for the banker;
A brand-new Bible for the priest; and a bottle of whisky for the wit.
Then, he hid behind the curtain and peeked.
The son came in whistling, saw the things on the table at a glance, looked around quickly, and after confirming that there was no one in the room, he first took a picture of the money in the bright place,
Then he flipped through the refurbished Bible, opened the cork and smelled it, then quickly picked up three things, stuffed the money into his pocket, put the wine bottle under his arm, held the Bible in both hands, and blew Whistled away.
Wilson couldn't help exclaiming: "My God! He's going to be a politician!"
