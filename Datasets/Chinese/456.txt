A deputy director of the competition director had three dreams at night:
For the first time, I dreamed of wearing a raincoat and holding an umbrella!
The second dream is to ride a bicycle on the wall!
The third dream was to sleep naked with my sister-in-law back to back!

The next day I asked my wife to interpret the dream, and the wife said:
1. Wearing a raincoat and an umbrella is superfluous.
2. Cycling on the wall is nowhere to go.
The third dream is your wishful thinking!
It seems that you have no hope of promotion!
The deputy director was immediately sent to the hospital after hearing this!

The mother-in-law came to visit when she heard the news, and she patted her thigh and said, "What a dream!
1. Wearing a raincoat and an umbrella is double insurance
2. Riding a bicycle on the wall shows that you are superior in skill and ability
3. I dreamed of sleeping with my sister-in-law facing away from you, and I knew that you would turn over sooner or later...
