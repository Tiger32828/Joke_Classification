An elderly but still spirited golfer goes to the priest to ask if there is a golf course in heaven.
The priest thought about it for a while and said that he would check it out and give him an answer the next day.
The next day, the old man came again. "I got both good news and bad news," said the priest.
"Then tell me the good news first."
"There is a very wide golf course in heaven," said the priest. "It has green lawns, the best equipment, and there are many, many landscapes that you can't even imagine on earth..."
The old man was immediately immersed in the yearning for that beautiful paradise.
The priest reminded: "I have to inform you now: it will be your turn to serve next Sunday morning."
