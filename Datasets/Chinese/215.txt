It is said that when Sun Yat-sen, the founding father, was dying, he suddenly felt dry and wanted to drink some water.

But the mouth did not obey, only said: "Drink..."
The comrades at the side even consciously wrote the word "peace".
The founding father is angry~ He blurted out to scold them as bastards,
The mouth only said: "Hum..." the word,
Comrade immediately wrote "struggle" again.
The founding father was half-dead from their anger! ! Panting and shouting, "Save...Save me~~"
Of course, comrades know that this must be "saving China".
At the same time, the founding father died... From now on, the last word of the founding father was....
"Peace", "Struggle", "Save China"
