father in son's eyes
7 years old: "Dad is amazing, he knows everything!"
14 years old: "It seems that sometimes it's not right..."
20 years old: "Dad is a bit outdated, his theories are out of sync with the times."
25 years old: "The 'Old Man' is old-fashioned and doesn't know anything."
Age 35: "If Dad was as sophisticated as I was, he would be a millionaire today..."
45 years old: "I don't know if I should discuss it with the 'old man', maybe he can give me an idea..."
Age 55: "It's a pity that my dad passed away. To be honest, he had a very good opinion!"
60 years old: "Poor Dad! You are an all-knowing scholar! It's a pity I got to know you too late!"
