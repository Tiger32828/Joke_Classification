The middle-aged man was walking alone on the beach when he suddenly kicked a hard object and looked down at an oil lamp.
He picked it up, wiped off the sand with his sleeve, and a giant lamp appeared.
The middle-aged man asked, "Are there three wishes?"
Deng Shen replied, "No, that's the usual exaggeration in fairy tales. I can only fulfill one wish for you."
The middle-aged Han made a request: "I really want to travel to the Grand Canyon of the United States, but I'm afraid of flying; my friend suggested a cruise, but I'm afraid of seasickness. Could you build a bridge to connect Taiwan and the United States?"
The lamp god scolded: "Crazy! Do you know how much steel and cement it takes to build such a long bridge? I won't do the impossible, think of a more realistic wish!"
The middle-aged man said, "I've been married three times and divorced three times, and every wife blames me for not understanding her. Can you enlighten me on what's going on in my head when a woman doesn't speak? Saying ' What do you really want when you don't need it?"
Deng Shen sighed and said, "The Trans-Pacific Bridge, do you want a two-lane or four-lane lane?"
