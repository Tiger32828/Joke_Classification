In summer, the students like to go to the river to play in the water, a group of people have a lot of fun,
Only one female classmate, Xiaomei, sat helplessly by the river and looked at the water.
His classmate Ade came to him and asked him, the following is their conversation...
Ade: "Xiaomei, why don't you play with us?"
Xiaomei pointed to the river and said innocently, "Look! It's dangerous!"
Ade: "The water isn't very deep, it's safe."
Xiaomei: "No! Look at the tadpoles on the water..."
Ade said with a smile, "It's summer now, of course there will be tadpoles on the water, don't worry the tadpoles won't bite you."
Xiaomei said nervously, "No! Dangerous, tadpoles are dangerous..."
Ader asked, "Tadpoles are dangerous? Why?"
Xiaomei lowered her head and said in a low voice, "The textbook teaches...you will get pregnant." Ade fainted after hearing this.
