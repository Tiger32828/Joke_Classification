The Chinese New Year is almost here, so let's send you a couple of Spring Festival couplets.

The upper link is:
Thin and fat left home and returned home,
The local accent has not changed into piles of meat.

The next link is:
Children who do not know each other,
Who are you, fat man?

Horizontal batch: return home with tight clothes
