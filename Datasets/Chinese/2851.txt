One day, our family was drinking soda, my brother accidentally knocked over the soda, and my mother was busy wiping the overturned soda.
Wiping and wiping, my sister also knocked over, and my mother was angry. Then I knocked over too, and my mother got even more angry.
As a result, the father also overturned, and the mother added fuel to the fire! In the end, even my mother overturned herself!
This incident made us both angry and funny, and my mother said angrily, I can't buy soda anymore! Our family can no longer drink soda because of this!
