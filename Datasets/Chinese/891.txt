Dong Zhuo invited Lu Bu, Li Ru and other confidants to a banquet, and Diao Chan was there to accompany him.
Zhuo wanted to test everyone's loyalty, so he ordered Chan to paint his breasts black.
During the banquet, the candle went out suddenly, and after the candle was bright again, everyone's hands were black, and the hands were clean.
Zhuo Sui admired the cloth, cloth smiled, and showed black teeth.
