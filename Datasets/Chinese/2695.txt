One night, a beautiful woman was invited by her host to a feast, and she was arranged to sit next to the great British statesman Grad Toton.
And the next night, he asked her to sit next to his equally famous political opponent, Disraeli.
Later, when I asked her how these celebrities made her impression, she thought for a while and replied:
"I came out of my meal sitting next to Mr Grad Totton, who I thought was the smartest man in Britain.
But I came out sitting next to Mr Disraeli and I thought I was the smartest woman in England. "
