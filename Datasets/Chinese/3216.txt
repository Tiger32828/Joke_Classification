One summer, a dog from the city got into a fight with a porcupine. The owner brought it in for medical attention, and the veterinarian treated the dog for about an hour.
The dog owner asked him how much the consultation cost. "Fifteen bucks, ma'am," he replied.
"It's so expensive!" she growled.
"You country folks know how to deceive summer tourists. We're not here to extort you in winter, so what do you do for a living?"
"Raising porcupines, ma'am."
