One summer afternoon, the weather was very hot, so my stomach was not feeling well;
In fact, when I was in class that morning, I had an "urge" to fart very much (I am easily deflated),
But because I was in public, I kept holding back and didn't want to cause trouble to others.
Later in the afternoon, because my math test was so good, I was in a good mood, so I joked with my classmates.
Just when I was laughing and leaning forward and backward, but because the forward leaning action was too hard, the "qi" in that stomach,
They were all lined up, only to hear a loud noise of "Pfft..."!
(also pulling wire)
The whole class suddenly became quiet, subconsciously put their hands on their noses, and said in unison:
"Who's farting?" Of course, my classmates and I held our noses together and said with a wry smile, "Um...that smells bad!"
It really embarrassed me!
