The mother works in the kitchen while listening to the sound of her son playing with the newly bought electric train in the living room.
She heard her son say when the train came to a stop, "You son of a bitch getting off the train, get me off you son of a bitch because it's the last stop. And you son of a bitch getting on, get your Move your ass up because we're going to drive."
The mother went to the living room and told her son, "How can you use such rude language. Now I want you to go into the room to reflect for two hours, and when you come back to play the train, use polite language."
After two hours, the son came out of the room and continued to play with his train, and soon the train stopped.
The mother heard her son say, "All passengers who are going to get off the train, please remember to bring your personal belongings. Thank you for taking this train and wish you a wonderful journey. We look forward to your next visit."
"For passengers who have just boarded the train, please put all your luggage under your seat. Please remember that all areas except the club compartment are non-smoking areas. I hope you can have a comfortable and relaxing journey with us."
"As for the passengers who complain about the train being delayed by 2 hours, please find that bitch in the kitchen."
