One night, Mr. Zhang drove his taxi to wait for passengers on the street. Soon, a young woman called his taxi to the airport.
During the period, the young woman took out a red apple to eat. Seeing that she ate one after another,
Mr. Zhang couldn't help but ask, "Miss, do you like eating apples very much?"
The young woman replied, "Yes! I liked eating apples the most during my lifetime."
After hearing this, Mr. Zhang's face turned blue, but the young woman continued, "But after giving birth, I didn't like eating too much."
