Once upon a time, there was a horse! It ran and fell into the sea.
So, it becomes a "seahorse"!
The horse's other horse friend, in order to find the horse that was lost in the sea, ended up falling into the river. Later, he became a "hippo".
The third horse is a white horse. In order to find two missing friends, it came to a city with chaotic traffic.
It was run over by several cars in a row, causing several black stripes to appear on its body.
As a result, it became a "zebra"!
In order to find the first three companions, the fourth horse came to a factory one day and was transformed into an "iron horse".
But later, those horses still could not escape the fate of being eaten. They were all made into "Shaqi horses", and all the horses were ravaged. No one was spared, and it became a horseless world...
Then, after seeing this joke, a group of people couldn't help but say: "Ma's ~ it's really cold".
Finally, in honor of this joke, someone codified it into a class, let's call it "Marseille Class"!
