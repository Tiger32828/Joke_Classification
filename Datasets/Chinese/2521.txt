Da stayed to visit Ade's house, and Ade was not there, and his wife was embroidering——
Dazed looked at it in admiration, and said, "Your embroidery is so beautiful!"
Mrs. Ader replied, "It's too much. If you like it, I'll embroider one for you another day!"
When Dada came home, he told his wife about it, and praised Mrs. Ader for her very decent answer.
A few days later, Ader came to visit Dadai, who happened to be not at home, his wife was playing with the child.
Ade praised: "Your child is so beautiful, chubby and cute!"
Da Dui's wife said proudly, "You have won the prize! If you like it, I will give birth to one for you another day!"
