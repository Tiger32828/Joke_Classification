A female colleague changed her Line name to "Little Wife" because she was in a bad mood.
The next day, two people in the company asked for leave, four were late, six had dark circles, one had panda eyes, and three lame people came with crutches!
The boss asked the reason, and they all said: My wife saw that I had a little wife on Line, and they would fight if they could not tell the difference.
