Not long ago, airlines taught English, Taiwanese, and Mandarin all three languages, so flight attendants began to learn how to guide passengers on various precautions in Taiwanese.
One day, flight attendant A wanted to test her Taiwanese skills on a whim. It happened that most of the passengers on the plane were husbands and wives (to travel abroad and enjoy happiness),
So when the passenger's destination was about to arrive, flight attendant A began to say in Taiwanese: "Ladies and gentlemen, the cemetery has arrived, the sacrifice has been passed down, and I will also cover it and say goodbye."
