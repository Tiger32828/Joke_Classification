I was cleaning the paint department in the store when a woman came in to buy paint for the kitchen.
She didn't know the size of the kitchen, I thought she would make a random estimate, but she picked up the broom and swept the floor.
I followed her to a sudden stop and asked how big the area was swept in total. After I told her, she laughed.
"My kitchen is this big," she said.
