It is said that a student was preparing to pre-select classes for the next semester at the end of the semester, but the content of the system was different this time.
The content is as follows: "Hello, please enter the student number and press the pound sign, please press 5 to drop out of school, press 6 to withdraw from school, and press 7 to resume school."
Driven by curiosity, the student pressed "5", only to hear the system answer "Successfully dropped out", and the student's face changed drastically.
At this time, another hope emerged in my heart. Didn't I just hear that pressing 7 for resumption of school? So he pressed "7",
I only heard the system answer: "Sorry, non-students from our school are not allowed to use this system."
