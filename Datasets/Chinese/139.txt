The three anglers met at the pier and had a good conversation, so they decided to go fishing together.
However, when they were fishing offshore, they encountered a storm and the boat sank. The three of them were lucky to swim to a small island and were rescued.
On the island, although there is abundant food and the climate is good, life is very boring.
One day, the three of them were walking on the beach when they suddenly found an oil lamp. Someone took it and wiped it, and a huge elf appeared in the lamp.
The elf said: "You let me out, I want to fulfill three wishes for you, tell me!" The three of them were overjoyed, so they decided to make one wish each.
The first said, "I'm a rancher, I miss my ranch and my wife, and I want to go back to my hometown."
The elf said, "Yes!" With a whoosh, the rancher was gone.
The second said, "I'm a taxi driver, and I miss my family and my car so much. I want to go home and continue driving the taxi."
The elf said, "Yes!" With a whistle, the taxi driver disappeared.
The elf asked the third person's wish, and the person said, "I am a homeless man. I have always made my home in heaven and earth. It is not bad to be carefree here, but life is too boring. I hope the two of them will come back to accompany me!"
The elf said, "Yes!" With two swishes, the rancher and the cab driver returned.
