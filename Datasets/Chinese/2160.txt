Lao Zhang went for an injection, and the injection room was full of people. As soon as he arrived at the door, he heard an old nurse say, "Today is the last day of your practice. Everyone is ready for the assessment!"
Lao Zhang was taken aback and thought to himself, "Nurse intern? I went out for a walk!"
When I came back, the noise in the injection room had disappeared, and I could only vaguely hear: "These children are making the patients so miserable!"
Lao Zhang was delighted, walked in and said, "Injection!"
When the old nurse saw him, she turned her head and shouted, "The nurse who failed just now, come out to make up the exam."
