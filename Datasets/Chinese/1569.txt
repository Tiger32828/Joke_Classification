The director of the office is very rigid in his work. Whenever he has instructions, he always writes it down on paper and asks his subordinates to sign for it.
One day, he was going to install a row of pedestals in his room. Workers drilled holes in the wall with an electric drill. The deaf sound was very harsh.
The colleague just came back from outside and whispered to the person next to him in surprise: "My God, he is going to engrave instructions on the wall now."
