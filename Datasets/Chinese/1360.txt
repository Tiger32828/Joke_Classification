One afternoon, three people entered a convenience store at the same time, and the owner quickly got up to say hello.
Boss: "Ah... hello, do you need anything? ? ' said the boss to the first guest.
The first customer: "Boss, I want a pack of Bao Keke"
The boss looked back at the shelf and found that all the treasures were piled up in the locker above his head, and he hadn't taken them out.
Boss: "Yes ... yes ... wait a moment. 』
After speaking, the boss picked up the cumbersome stairs very hard, climbed up very hard, stretched out his hand to open the door of the cabinet, took out a bag of poka, very hard, climbed down the stairs very hard, and then It was very laborious to put the stairs back in place.
After selling it to the first customer, the boss felt that all the hard work was worth it, so he happily asked the second customer: "Sir, what do you need? ? 』
The second guest said, "I want a pack of pokeka too. 』
The boss couldn't help scolding in his heart: "I rely on...why didn't we just say it together..."
But the boss still worked hard to pick up the cumbersome stairs, climbed it very hard, stretched out his hand to open the door of the cabinet, and took out a bag of Bao Keke very hard,
As he was about to climb down the stairs, he suddenly remembered: 'Could the third guest play me like this? ! 』
So, he said loudly to the third guest below: "Hey...that gentleman...do you want a pack of pokeka too?" 』
The third guest shook his head: "No! 』
The boss walked down the stairs with confidence and sold the bag of Bao Keke to the second customer.
After the second guest left, the boss turned around and asked the third guest, "Then... Sir, what do you need? ? 』
The third guest said: "Boss, I want three packs of Bao Keke! ! 』
