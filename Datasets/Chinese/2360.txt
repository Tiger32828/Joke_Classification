My buddy is highly valued by the boss in the unit.
One day the boss asked him, "What dreams do you have?"
The buddy thought for a while and replied, "I want to open my own company..."
The boss said dismissively: "This is too far away, let's be realistic~"
The buddy thought about it again, then said cautiously, "I think...I want a raise..."
The boss laughed and said, "This is farther away! Let's be more realistic!"
