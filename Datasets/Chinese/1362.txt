Question: A turtle, a frog, a tortoise and a toad, four animals work together to deal with one thing.
After processing...
Turtle said: "Turtle, you can go, hurry up, we have to rest in place, drink water, and chat for a while!"
Both Frog and Toad agreed, "That's right~ Turtle, hurry up! We still have something to talk about!"
The tortoise was helpless, but could not be driven away.
Why can't the tortoise stay?
