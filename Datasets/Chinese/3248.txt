A middle-aged man who didn't know much about computers, after he bought a computer and went home, he accidentally pressed the button of the CD player while he was surfing the Internet.
The next day, he called the computer dealer and said, "The computer I bought from you is very good, but the shelf for holding the coffee cups is very fragile, and it breaks when I put it on."
