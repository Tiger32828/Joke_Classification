It is said that after Jiang Gong died, he met the founding father in heaven. The founding father asked him, "How will democracy work after I die?"
Jiang Gong said, "It's very successful!" The founding father said happily: "Who was the first president?" Jiang Gong proudly said, "It's me!"
The founding father said: "Very good! What about the second term?" Jiang Gong said embarrassedly: "Yu Youren." (Yu Youren President)
The founding father said: "Okay! The calligrapher is the president, what about the third term?" Jiang Gong: "Wu Sanlian."
Father of the Founding: "Okay! The press is also a president! What about the fourth term?" Jiang Gong: "Zhao Lilian." (As usual, re-elected president)
Father of the Founding Father: "Okay! Educators are also presidents. What about the fifth term?" Jiang Gong: "Zhao Yuanren." (As the original president)
Father of the Founding Father: "That's great! There is also a president in the public opinion circle! What about the sixth term?" Jiang Gong: "Wu Zixu." (My son continues)
At this time, the founding father asked suspiciously: "Do even the ancients come to be the president?"
