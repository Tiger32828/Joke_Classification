The king inspects the prison. He asked what sentence a prisoner had been sentenced to.
"Life imprisonment, Your Majesty!"
"Warden, pass my order and sentence him to half life imprisonment."
OMG! No one knew how to carry out the king's orders.
A wise warden came up with a brilliant idea. He said to the warden:
"According to His Majesty's order, this prisoner should be jailed for a day and released home for a day until he dies."
