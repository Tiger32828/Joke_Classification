Two days before Valentine's Day, a man arrived at the post office with a large bag of cards to send...!
The postman looked at the letters in the bag and found that there were hearts on them, and they were all sprayed with fragrant perfume.
The postman couldn't help being curious, so he asked the man who sent the letter, "How many letters are there in total?"
Man: "There are probably more than 500 letters!"
Postman: "Wow! So many! Are they all your girlfriends?"
Man: "No! These are all nearby neighbors!"
Postman: "What's in there?"
Man: "Write some nasty words, provocative words! Finally, sign "Love your sweetheart"!"
Postman: "Then I don't understand! These people aren't your girlfriends, so why are you sending them?"
The man said in a low voice, "I'm... the only lawyer in the neighborhood who is filing a divorce lawsuit!"
