A dog wandering the street saw a sign in the window: "Recruiting staff. Must be typing, computer literate, bilingual. Equal opportunity."
The dog went in and applied, but was rejected. "I can't hire a dog to work in the company," the manager said.
The dog was not convinced and pointed to the words "equal opportunity" on the sign to protest. The manager couldn't help but sighed and asked, "Can you type?"
The dog walked silently to the typewriter and typed a letter with precision. "Do you know how to use a computer?" the manager asked.
The dog sat in front of the computer and programmed it to work correctly. "I really can't hire a dog for this job," the manager said in a huff.
"Even if they can type and understand computers, I need employees who can speak two languages." The dog looked up at the manager and said, "Meow."
