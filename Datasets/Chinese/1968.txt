Ten years later, we inadvertently met again, and she asked me in a low voice, "How have you been all these years? She's been nice to you."
I was very sad and said, "I'm not married yet, I've been waiting for you."
Her eyes were red, and she said, "Come to the hotel at 7 o'clock to find me."
On the night of Qixi Festival, the moon is like a hook. I came to the hotel half an hour early with flowers in hand. She welcomed me in and greeted me to sit down.
Youyou asked, "Have you heard of An Li?"
