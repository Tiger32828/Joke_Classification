Xiao Ming's face is very big, and the whole class laughed at him. His face was as big as a kite, so Xiao Ming was very sad and sad. When the teacher entered the classroom, he couldn't help laughing at him.
Xiao Ming couldn't stand such a blow, so he ran out sadly, and on his way home, he flew up as he ran!
