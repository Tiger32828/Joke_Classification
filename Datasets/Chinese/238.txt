There is a group of college students going to a social gathering, and the male college students want to say that everyone rides a motorcycle and wants to play the game of picking keys.
As a result, there was a man who liked to be handsome and drove a BMW, so everyone was very upset and decided to fight the guy who drove by Kang Kang.

They tried to get all the dinosaurs to ride in his car, and the man was very upset.
Then the dinosaur said to the boy who was driving, "Alas, you are so cool~ Why don't you talk?"
The boy didn't turn his head and said coldly, "Have you ever seen a garbage truck driver talking to garbage?"
