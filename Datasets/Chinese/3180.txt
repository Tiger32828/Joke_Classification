The newspaper reported that the Justice Department had cleared him of using undue influence to help his brother run an oil business,
Couldn't help but smile. His younger son saw it and asked him why he was so happy.

The son asked, "What does 'wash out' mean?"
"It just means I didn't do anything," Carley said.
The child said, "Everyone in my school always says that about you."
