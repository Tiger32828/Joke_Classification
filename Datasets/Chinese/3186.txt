Our team of recruits, after weeks of training and suffering, had a very short temper.
One morning, we were lining up to listen to the squad leader's stern lectures when suddenly a big rock flew past and hit the squad leader in the head just a few moments later.
The squad leader blushed with anger, and kept walking towards the direction of the flying stones at the back of the team, calling out to a recruit who was known for his mischief, "It must be you!"
However, the recruit answered very well: "Squad leader! If it were me, the force must be very strong, and the stone must be bigger - and at the same time, it will never miss the target!"
