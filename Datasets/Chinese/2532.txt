There is a psychiatrist who is treating a mentally deviated child.
The child cried and said, "I want to eat earthworms!"
When the doctor heard this, he said, "Why eat earthworms?"
The child said, "Because that is noodles!"
In order to find out the reason for the child's psychological deviation, the doctor asked the nurse to go to the garden outside and dig a ball of earthworms back.
The doctor said, "Here are the worms! Eat it!" The child said, "No! I want to fry it."
The doctor thought to himself, "Why is this kid so weird!"
In order to find out the reason for his psychological deviation, he asked the nurse to fry the earthworms again. After it was fried, the doctor took the plate and gave it to the child. The doctor said, "Come... eat it!"
The child said, "I only need one, and the doctor will eat the other!"
The doctor thought to himself, "Fuck him, lie to him first, and wait until he eats it." So the doctor said yes.
At this time, the child continued: "The doctor wants to eat first, and then I will eat!"
This time, changing doctors is a big deal! In order to treat this child, in the end, the doctor had to bite the bullet and eat one of the earthwormsâ€”
Suddenly, the child began to cry! Crying and saying, "The earthworm I want to eat has been eaten by you, I don't want to eat it..."
