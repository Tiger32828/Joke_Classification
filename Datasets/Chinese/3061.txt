There is a small acrobatic troupe in London's Piccadilly Street that is putting on a show: a man who is locked in a glass box on a hunger strike for 30 days.
News reporter Kathy heard about this and went to interview the man on hunger strike.
She asked through the glass box wall, "Why are you doing this kind of show?"
The man replied, "It's not just for the sake of eating!"
