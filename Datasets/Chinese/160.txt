Ah'Dai is a very bad person. Every time he buys a motorcycle, he gets stolen.
One day, he bought a new locomotive.
He thought to himself, "Every time it's stolen, I'll buy it five big locks this time and see how you steal it!"
When he went out to eat at noon, he took five large locks and locked them all on the locomotive.
Then a large note was posted on the car: "Hahaha! Let's see how you steal!" So I went to eat happily.
After eating, come back and move the car,
"Wow" A'Dai showed a very happy expression
The car is still there!


But when he looked forward, his face turned green. . . .
Because if you look closely, five locks become six locks.
Then there was a note on it: "Hey hey hey! Let's see how you ride!"
