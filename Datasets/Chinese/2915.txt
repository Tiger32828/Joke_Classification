One night, a young girl and a handsome male hired hand walked side by side on a secluded country road.
The hired hand carried a large bucket on his shoulders, a broiler in one hand, a cane in the other, and a goat at the same time.
They walked into a long, quiet dark alley.
"I dare not walk with you here," said the girl, "perhaps you want to kiss me!"
"I'm carrying so many things," the male worker asked. "How is that possible?"
"That's hard to say," said the girl, "what if you put a cane in the mud, tie the sheep to it, and put the chickens in the bucket?"
