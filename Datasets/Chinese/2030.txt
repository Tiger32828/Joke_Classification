Xiao Ming is the monitor, but he often falls asleep in class, and every time he calls out a password after class, Xiao Hua next door reminds Xiao Ming.
One day Xiaoming fell asleep again in class, Xiaohua suddenly became playful, and shook Xiaoming and said, "Class is over!"
Before Xiao Ming opened his eyes, he shouted, "Stand up."
In an instant, more than a dozen students in the class stood up, and each one's eyes were closed.
The teacher on the stage, the classmates who were sitting were startled, and the classmates who were standing were even more puzzled. Only Xiaohua laughed heartily.
