Ahui, who recently lost his job, wanted to go see if he had a suitable job because he was in a bad mood.
He went around the street and said to his friend Awen when he came back.
"Oh my god -- it's so bad -- the streets are full of pigs"
"The streets are full of pigs?! No way?... Whose pigs?"
"A lot of shops are closed - "Rent" is posted on the iron gate"
