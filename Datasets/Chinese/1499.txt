A guy went to the hospital for a checkup and had many tests done.
The doctor said, "There is good news and there is bad news! After reading your test results, I found out that you are potentially homosexual! And it is difficult to cure!"
The guy said, "Oh my God! What about the good news?"
The doctor said shyly, "I found you quite cute."
