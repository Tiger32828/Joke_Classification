A young lady went to practice golf with friends for the first time.
When she served the ball, she swung it so hard that the ball was hit crooked and flew towards a group of people. Then she saw a man fall to the ground with his hands between his thighs and roll down the hill in pain.
The young lady ran over to apologize and told the victim that she had learned some nursing and hoped to check on him before the ambulance arrived.
The injured person felt that it was unnecessary, but the lady insisted, and the others also persuaded the injured patient to let her check first, and the injured patient had to reluctantly agree.
The lady wants the injured person to lie down first, relax his whole body, then pull his hands apart and lay them flat on both sides of the body, then gently unzip the injured person's trousers, put his hand in, and touch it gently. on.
She asked the injured, "How does it feel here?"
The injured person said helplessly, "It feels good there, but my thumb still hurts to death!"
