Someone came back from a trip abroad and looked sullen, so his wife asked, "Aren't your employees traveling fun?"
Someone said, "Forget it, the place where I live is broken and dirty, and I'm still bitten by insects."
The wife asked, "Why is this happening? Didn't the company tell you to stay in a 'five-star' hotel?"
Someone: "That's right, the company is talking about staying in a 'money-saving' hotel!"
