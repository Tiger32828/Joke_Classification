Medical students find the following questions on exam papers:
"Write five reasons why it's better for babies to have breast milk than cow's milk!"
Without thinking, he wrote:
"First, because breast milk is fresher; second, breast milk is cleaner; third, it won't be stolen by cats; fourth, it's easy to carry when traveling."
After writing the above four points, he thought for a while and continued to write: "Fifth, because this is squeezed out of a clever storage."
He actually passed.
