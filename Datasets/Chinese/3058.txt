Someone calling himself a "prophet".
People asked him, "What does it mean for you to be the representative of the prophet?"
He replied, "Can I know what's on your mind?"
"What are we thinking?" the guys asked.
He smiled and replied, "I know you're thinking 'this guy is not a prophet at all, but a complete liar'!"
