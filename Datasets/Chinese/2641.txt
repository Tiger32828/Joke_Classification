There was a homeless man who couldn't find a job anywhere, so he bought 40 steamed buns and tried to commit suicide by lying on the train tracks.
Later, I showed it to a friend and asked him, "Since you committed suicide, why are you holding so many steamed buns?"
He replied, "If the train doesn't come, am I going to starve to death?"
