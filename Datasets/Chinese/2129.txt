One day, a cowboy in a PUB was approaching a beautiful girl.
Beauty: "Wow!! What a big hat!"
Cowboy: "YES! Because I live in Texas." Then he lit a cigar.
Beauty: "Wow! What a big cigar!"
Cowboy: "YES! Because I live in Texas." He ordered another beer.
Beauty: "Wow!! What a big glass of beer!"
Cowboy: "YES! Because I live in Texas."
At this time, when the cowboy saw that the time was ripe, he went straight to the point, and the beauty did not object, so he was going to turn the tide, and the cowboy took off his pants...
Beauty: "Wow! What a big one... (I think everyone understands!)"
Cowboy: "YES! Because I live in Texas."
After a while, the cowboy stopped abruptly and said dissatisfiedly, "Where do you live in Texas?"
