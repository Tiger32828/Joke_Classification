A farmer, unable to recognize many characters. One day in the scorching sun, he came into the city, his mouth was dry, and he wanted to find a place to sell water.
Suddenly, I saw a plaque hanging in front of a store, which said: Qingshuichi. It was supposed to be a bathhouse, but he only knew the word "water" in the middle, so he thought it was the place where water was sold, and he had to let the person who ran the hall bring the water.
The shopkeeper couldn't beat him, so he had someone bring out a bowl of bath water.
How can this person control the taste, "gudonggudong" drink it after a few sips.
After thanking him, he left, but dropped the fan on the counter. The shopkeeper saw it and ran forward to return it to him.
The farmer was very grateful, and said, "The shopkeeper, you should sell your tea as soon as possible! It's already a little rancid."
