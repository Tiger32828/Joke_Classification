One day, Xiao Ming stopped a car on the road. Whenever he saw a passing car, he raised his right thumb to make a free-rider gesture and shouted, "Hitchhiker, hitchhiker."
Suddenly, a car galloped past Xiao Ming and braked immediately.
Xiao Ming was excited for a while, and finally Huangtian lived up to the painstaking efforts. When he was about to step forward, the car had already reversed to Xiao Ming's position.
The owner of the car rolled down the window and said, "If you dare to call me this car again, I will kill you."
