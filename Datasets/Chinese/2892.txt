There is a university's Department of Archaeology and Anthropology and Department of Foreign Affairs, for some reason, forged a beam.
One day, on the bulletin board of the Department of Foreign Affairs, a poster appeared with a picture of a man wearing deep glasses,
An odd-looking woman with a hoe on her shoulders, with a note beside her: "There are no beautiful women in the archaeology department."
Two days later, a large poster was posted on the bulletin board of the Department of Archaeology, with two lines neatly written on it:
"In line with the spirit of revealing unknown facts, the Department of Archaeology continues to work hard to uncover the infinite potential of female students.
In the spirit of covering up known facts, the Department of Foreign Affairs continues to work hard to cover up the only fact that there is no beauty in the Department of Foreign Affairs. "
