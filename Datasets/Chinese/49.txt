The chairman's assistant was named Guangguang. One day the chairman asked the assistant to buy egg tarts and distribute them to the company's employees.

After a female supervisor ate it, she was surprised that it was delicious. …

The chairman said, I asked Guangguang to buy it. If you like it, you can also ask Guangguang to buy it.

The female supervisor asked with embarrassment: Do you have to strip?

The chairman said that it is ok not to rely on the light, but it is faster to buy with the light.

Otherwise, wait a minute and I will take you there with Guangguang‼
