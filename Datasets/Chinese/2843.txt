One day, on the school bus, I put my schoolbag on the shelf above my seat.
I didn't expect that not long after the car started, my schoolbag suddenly fell off and hit my sister's head. I was very embarrassed to apologize to her.
At this time, the driver suddenly made a big turn, and the schoolbag that had just been put back fell off again and hit me hard on the head!
Embarrassed, I had to put it back again. The senior who was hit laughed and said to me, "It hurts!"
At that time, I really wanted to dig a hole in the ground to get in, thinking to myself, "It's really self-inflicted, I can't live!"
I didn't expect that after a while, my book was scattered on the ground with a sudden "pop", and the red test paper also flew out, and even......
Even my "Xiao Mian Mian" rolled out! I saw the seniors behind me laughing together! It's over, the image is gone....
