The 36th President of the United States, Johnson, likes to play with small animals.
Once, in front of the camera of a photojournalist, he grabbed his beagle by the ears and picked it up, and the puppy screamed.
"I like to hear them bark," he added.
When the National Animal Lovers Association learned of the incident, it staged a protest, accusing Jensen of cruelty to animals.
This forced Jensen to "clarify" this fact in public. He explained ingeniously:
"I bet the dog's bark wasn't a pain, it was a happy bark."
