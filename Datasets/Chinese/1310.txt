In ancient times there was a father and daughter, and the daughter wanted to marry an object that her father did not like.
The father was very angry, and the daughter began to cry.
Dad said, "I hate you women crying the most. Anyway, I just don't want you to marry him."
Then he rode away.
But in the end the daughter still got married, why?


Because Dad said while riding a horse: Marry! marry! marry!
