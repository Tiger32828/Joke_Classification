Grandma is 90+ this year,
She smokes at least two packs of cigarettes a day.
The granddaughter was worried when she saw it, and persuaded the grandmother to say:
"Grandma, smoking less cigarettes is not good for your lungs, and you will cough later."
The old grandmother didn't even look at her, she knocked on the ashes and said:
"Granddaughter, do you tell me that fresh meat spoils faster, or bacon spoils faster?"
