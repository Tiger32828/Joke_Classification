Once upon a time, there was a very poor man who believed in Lu Zu throughout his life. Lu Dongbin was moved by his enthusiasm.
Then he went down to the man's house. Seeing that he was so poor, he was very sympathetic. He stretched out a finger and pointed at a rock in the courtyard.
The rock instantly turned into brilliant gold, and Lu Dongbin asked the man, "Do you want this thing?" The man replied:
"No, I don't want to." Lu Dongbin said happily, "You are not greedy for money, and you are very sincere. I can teach you some immortal ways."
The man hurriedly said, "No, no, I want your finger."
When Lu Dongbin heard this, he was so frightened that he turned the gold back into a rock, and then he walked away. This man is going to shave my fingers, too cruel!
