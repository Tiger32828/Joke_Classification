One day you fell into the water, and the river goddess floated out of the water.
The goddess asked: "(fishing out a handsome man with long legs in his left hand) Did you drop this?"
I replied, "No."
The goddess asked, "(fishing out a handsome blond man with blue eyes in his right hand) What about this one?"
I replied, "Neither."
The goddess said, "Then let's go~ I don't dare to fish the other one that is too ugly."
