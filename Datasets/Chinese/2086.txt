In a mental hospital, three patients want to be discharged.
So the dean gave them three, each with a rabbit, and asked them to take good care of them to observe their recovery.

A month later...
The dean went to their room to look around, and when he arrived at the first person's room, the dean saw the first patient grabbing the rabbit's ears and wearing a helmet.
Dean: "Oh...it's no help..."

When I went to the second person's room, I didn't expect him to be the same as the first person!
The dean shook his head... he went out without saying anything.

In the third room...
The third patient lovingly stroked the rabbit's head
The dean was very satisfied and said, "Very good! You should be able to be discharged from the hospital. Unlike the previous two, you actually ride a rabbit like a motorcycle!"
Before the words were finished... the third patient said, "What? They have already left?" and took up the helmet...
