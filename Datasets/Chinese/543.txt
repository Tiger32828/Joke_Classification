There are two animals in the forest, a rabbit and a bear.
One day when the bear was going to poop, the bear asked the rabbit, "Do you want to poop?" The rabbit said, "Okay!",
So the bear and the rabbit pooped in the forest. The bear was all right, and the bear asked the rabbit, "Is it all right?" The rabbit said, "It's getting better soon."
The bear said to the rabbit, "Your big poop is so dirty in your fur." ​​The rabbit said, "It's okay."
The bear asked, "Aren't you afraid of getting dirty?" The rabbit said, "I'm not afraid of getting dirty."
The bear asked again, "Are you really not afraid of getting dirty?" The rabbit said, "I am really not afraid of getting dirty."

The bear picked up the rabbit.
