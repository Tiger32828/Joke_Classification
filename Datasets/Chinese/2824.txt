One day when the flag was raised, when the flag was half way up, a bird flew by and Xiao Ming suddenly squatted down.
The teacher thought he had a stomachache, so he ran over worriedly and asked him, "What's wrong?"
Only then did he hesitate and say, "There's bird poop on my head..."
At this time, the students were already laughing together!
