Early one morning, there was the sound of firecrackers, and I don't know who opened a small theater.
On the first day, a film was shown,
The advertisement reads "The Story of Seven Men and One Woman" and states: "A beautiful woman fainted for no reason, and seven men were forcibly dragged into the forest; waiting for the beautiful woman..."
Everyone found it very attractive to buy tickets to enter.
When the movie was shown, "Snow White" appeared on the big screen, and everyone left in a huff.

The next day, everyone passed the small theater again and saw that the advertisement had changed.
The advertisement reads "The Story of Seven Men and One Woman" and states: "Like the ecstasy of the beautiful flower and the seven men's stormy days (not "Snow White")"
This time everyone felt more attractive than last time, and it was not "Snow White", so they bought tickets to enter the venue, and the words "Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea" appeared on the big screen...
