The CEO of a company is interviewing someone who has come to apply for the position of chief accountant.
He asked each candidate, "What is two million plus two million?"
The first two candidates answered without hesitation: "Four million."
Neither got a job. When asked about the third applicant, he stood up,
He closed the door, drew the curtains, and asked the boss in a low voice, "How much do you want it to be?"
So, this person was hired.
