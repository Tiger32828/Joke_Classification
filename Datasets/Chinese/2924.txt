Wife: "Honey, let's make our future life sweet and sweet, all the big things in the future are up to you to decide, and all the little things follow my arrangement, how about that?"
Husband: "Then, to be specific, what small things do you arrange for you?"
Wife: "I decide what kind of job I should apply for, what kind of house I should live in, what kind of furniture I should buy, where I should go on vacation and things like that."
Husband: "Then what are the big things for me to decide?"
Wife: "You decide who will be prime minister, whether our country should increase aid to poor countries, what attitude we should take towards nuclear weapons, etc."
