When the officers of the United States, France and Russia were captured by the Germans and were about to be executed, the American officers shouted, "tornado!"
When it was the French officer's turn, he shouted, "earthquake!" The Germans fled again, and the French officer was rescued.
Finally, there was the Russian officer. After seeing the performance of the first two, he wanted to show off his English, so he shouted: "fire!"

Note: tornado→tornado, earthquake→earthquake, fire→fire, fire
