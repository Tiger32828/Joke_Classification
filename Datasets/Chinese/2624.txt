The teacher took out a stack of test papers and said that they would take a temporary test, and the classroom suddenly begged: "Teacher, don't! Take the test next time, we will definitely do well next time."
The teacher said, "Do you think of me as a three-year-old child!"
The students said, "No! We treat you as a pretty girl in your twenties."
The teacher smiled and said, "Okay, you guys won."
