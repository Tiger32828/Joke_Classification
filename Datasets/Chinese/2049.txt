Xiao Ming drives a new car with the hot and enthusiastic Xiaoying for a ride.
On the way, Xiaoying teased and caressed Xiaoming, causing Xiaoming's blood to burst into flames, and his car accidentally hit a telephone pole.
When the police arrived at the scene, they found that Xiaoying had flown out of the car and died on the spot, while Xiaoming was lying on the car with blood on his pants and crying.
Policeman: "What's it called? Your girlfriend flew out and was killed. Fortunately, you were wearing a seat belt, but you only suffered a little flesh wound. You are very lucky not to die, but you are so embarrassed to be called a ghost."
Xiao Ming: "Mr. Police is not my favorite ghost call, my life is over! Didn't you see something in my girlfriend's hand?!"
