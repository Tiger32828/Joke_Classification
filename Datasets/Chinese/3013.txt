A poor musician lives in an apartment in the center of London and arrives at his room in the middle of the night or in the early hours of the morning every day.
He was so tired, he always sat on the edge of the bed when he came back to the room, took off his two leather shoes,
He threw it on the floor "boom, boom", muttered "thank God", and fell asleep.
A poor tenant living downstairs was woken up by the sound of "dong, dong" every night.
The tenant couldn't take it anymore, so he complained to the musician. The kind musician felt very sorry.
When you promise to take off your shoes in the future, try to put them down as gently as possible.

The next day, be quick and faithful, the musician returned to the room from the club, sat down on the bed as usual, took off a leather shoe,
He threw it to the floor with a thud, and when he was about to take off his second leather shoe, he suddenly remembered what he had promised,
So very carefully put the other shoe gently on the rug and fell asleep.
An hour later, he was awakened by a loud knock on the door, and the tenant who lived downstairs stood before him,
The poor lodger stammered and pleaded, "Quick, quick, throw another shoe!
I've been waiting for an hour, and I can't fall asleep until you throw it away. "
