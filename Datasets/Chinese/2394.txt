In a women's high school, one day, a female classmate felt unwell and wanted to take a leave of absence to the health center...

But no one at the health center

Go to the instructor's room... but there is only one male instructor left in the instructor's room.

The female classmate said, "Instructor, I can't go to class today because I have menstrual pains"

The instructor said very badly: "You girls are like this, every time you have to take time off because of the pain, you don't respect the teacher at all!"

After training for a while, the instructor asked, "After talking so much, which muscle is hurting?"
