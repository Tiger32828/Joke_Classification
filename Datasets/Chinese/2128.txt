It is said that Xiao Ming likes toast bread the most.
One day, I found a certain bakery, so I went to buy a bag in high spirits and went home to enjoy...
Suddenly found that there is a "hair" in the bread, so angry Xiao Ming took the piece of bread and went to the boss to make a theory.
When I walked to the bakery, I happened to meet the owner who was making bread, so he hid behind the door and looked, trying to figure out how to make bread with roots in it.
Watching the boss prepare the flour, then make the dough, then hold a dough in his left hand, raise his right hand high to reveal his Galima, and put the dough in the Galima...
Just a piece of bread, a piece of bread, a piece of bread, a piece of bread, Xiao Ming rushed in to find the boss on the spot.
Xiao Ming said, "Boss, how can you do this, the bread is..."
The boss said calmly, "I'm fine like this~ Haven't you seen how the other side makes donuts?"
