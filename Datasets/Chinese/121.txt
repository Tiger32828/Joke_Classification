The owner of the orchard caught a child stealing guava in the orchard, and he was going to arrest him and go to his father for a theory. Halfway through, the boy said that he had left a piece of clothing in the orchard and forgot to pick it up.
"Okay!" said the owner of the orchard. "Go get your clothes. I'll wait for you here." The boy slipped away.
A few days later, the child came to steal the guava again, and was caught by the owner of the orchard again. "I won't let you run away this time," he said.
Halfway through the road, the child said, "Uncle, I left my clothes in the orchard." The owner of the orchard smiled and said, "You lied to me last time, but this time I won't be fooled again."
He said, "You wait for me here obediently, and I'll go back and find you clothes."
