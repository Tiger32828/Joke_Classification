There were three prisoners who were tried by a king. The king asked the first prisoner, "Are you going to die or swallow maggots?"
The first prisoner promised to be swallowed maggots, so the king said, "Swallow a thousand maggots!"
The king asked the second prisoner, "Do you want the death penalty or the swallowing of maggots?"
So the king said, "Swallow two thousand maggots!"
The king asked the third prisoner, "Do you want to die or swallow maggots?"
The third prisoner thought, "I have to swallow 3,000 maggots next. Instead of swallowing so many maggots, it is better to die a hundred times."
So he promised the death penalty, but the king said, "Swallow maggots to death!"
