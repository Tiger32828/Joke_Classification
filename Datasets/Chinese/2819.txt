Once, our school was cleaned.
When I was cutting the car, a classmate turned around, and the sickle he was cutting the car just slid through my pocket,
It caused a big hole in my pants, and my blue underwear with the YG logo came out!
What's even more embarrassing is that a group of female classmates were walking past me and saw my panties!
In the end, they walked and said with a smile, "Isn't that the underwear that elementary school students are wearing?"
At that time, I really wish I was an invisible person!
