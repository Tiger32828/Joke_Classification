A young girl and a dashing boy go on a date in the park.
Suddenly, Xiaosheng felt a little uneasy. The girl asked, "What's the matter with you?"
Xiaosheng said embarrassedly, "I want convenience."
The girl was puzzled, only to see Xiaosheng walking towards the public toilet, only to know that the "convenience" is to go to the toilet.
After a while, the girl asked Xiaosheng, "When are you going to play with me?"
Xiaosheng replied, "I want to go at your convenience."
