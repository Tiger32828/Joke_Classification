The salary is negotiated with the housewife during the interview.
Housewife: "How about giving you 1,500 yuan a month?"
Maid: "What are you doing?"
Housewife: "Cooking, washing, children and other odds and ends."
Maid: "And is there a game of cards?"
Housewife: "Sometimes there is entertainment."
Maid: "How many children do you have?"
Housewife: "Two, the elder is five years old and the younger is one year old."
Maid: "Maybe I can't see it! There is a river in front of the master's house, and a well to the left. If the child doesn't fall into the well, he has to roll down the river!"
When the housewife thinks about it, you say something unlucky and curse my child, very unhappy,
So he decided not to invite the worker, and said to the servant, "You can leave without looking after the child. I won't invite you!"
The servant looked around the house again and said, "It's fine to walk, you don't have a back door in this room. If the fire starts, I can't even run."
