A woman was so angry that she wanted to cry after arguing with her boyfriend, but she didn't dare to go home and cry because she loved face. Later, she suddenly thought of going to the funeral home to cry, because others would not find it strange.
So she found a mourning hall where a funeral was being held for an old man, and she felt relieved~ squatted on the ground and cried bitterly.
Two middle-aged women in black mourning clothes saw it and complained, "This bastard... there is actually a mistress outside."
After discussing it, he came over to help her up and comforted her and said, "Old third, seeing how sad you are crying, we decided to divide you 150 million in cash, other real estate and company stocks, etc. You just... Forget it, okay?"
This example tells us: "Going to the circle of strangers may have unexpected benefits! Expanding your network is important."
