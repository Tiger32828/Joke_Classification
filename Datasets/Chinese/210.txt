Xiao Zhen is a five-year-old girl who is afraid of the dark.
One night, her mother asked her to go to the backyard to get a mop, but Xiaozhen refused.
Her mother comforted her and said, "Don't be afraid, Xiaozhen, there is a Bodhisattva there and he will protect you."
Xiaozhen: "Are you sure the Bodhisattva is outside?"
Mom: "Of course! Bodhisattvas are omnipresent."
Xiaozhen: "Bodhisattva, are you outside? Can you help me bring the mop in?"
