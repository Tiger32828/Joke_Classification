The CIA needs a high-level assassin, and candidates who come to the job must go through a series of tests.
After layers of screening, three candidates, two men and one woman, were finally left...
The final test to determine who is the most ruthless

The examiner took the first man to a door, handed him a gun and said:
"We have to make sure that you can obey orders in any situation. Your wife is sitting in there, go in and kill her with this gun."
"How can I kill my wife!" the man asked with horror on his face.
He lost the election.

Then came the second man. After the chief examiner gave him the same task, he was surprised at first, but he still took the gun and entered the door.
Five minutes later, the man came out with tears on his face and said to the examiner, "I really can't do it."
Naturally, he also lost the election,

At last it was the woman's turn
When she was told that her husband was sitting inside and that she had to kill him, the woman took the gun without hesitation and walked in the door, before the door was closed, the sound of gunshots,
After thirteen shots were fired in succession, there were screams and the collision of chairs.
After a few minutes, everything was calm again...

The door opened, the woman came out, wiped the sweat from her forehead, and said angrily to the examiner: "You guys, you didn't tell me that the guns were filled with blanks, so I had to use a chair to put him smashed to death."
