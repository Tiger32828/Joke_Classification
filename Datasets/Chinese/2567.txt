One day, Xiaomin went bankrupt because of the stock crash. When he got home, his beautiful girlfriend immediately asked to break up.
Xiaomin said in surprise: "Are you really going to break up with me when I'm at my worst? Didn't you say that we were destined for marriage in a previous life?"
But his beautiful girlfriend said, "That's right! We are doomed by 'money'! Since you're out of money, we don't have to be together! ByeBye!"
