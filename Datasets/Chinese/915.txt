There was a weapon dealer who showed on the roadside. He said that the spear he made could pierce anything, but the shield he made couldn't penetrate anything.
At this time, a villager stood up and said, "You said that your spear can pierce anything, but your shield can't pierce anything, so what if you use your spear to pierce your shield?"
At this time, the merchant took up the spear and directly stabbed the villager to death.

Then he said, "You TM have the most problems."
