A man admires a pretty girl very much, but he is shy by nature,
So he had to secretly observe the woman's inertial itinerary, looking at the woman from a distance. After he observed it for a while,
He found that the girl would go to a beef noodle shop to eat noodles every Wednesday, and he followed the woman,
The more I saw her in the noodle shop, the more I felt that she was elegant and beautiful.
So he got up and went to the lady's side and boldly asked her, "Miss, what's your name?"
The lady was startled by the sudden sound, and answered in a loud voice:

"I... my name is Beef Noodles!"
