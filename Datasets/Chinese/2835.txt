One day, my sister, who was in the second grade of elementary school, came to the school to find me, and pointed to a corner of the campus,
She said enviously, "Second sister, your school is good! The workers in our school are not pretty, but the workers in your school are wearing suits!"
I looked in the direction of her finger, and there was really a person in a suit who was watering the flowers!
I was wondering when the school workers would change to suits when the man slowly turned his head.......
When I saw that man's face clearly, I couldn't help laughing. It turned out that he was a great principal!
