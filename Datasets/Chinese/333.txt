(I hit the iron gate with my motorcycle, and I was disfigured.)

I finally found the Zen master who lived in seclusion in the mountains, and I couldn't wait to ask, "I'm ugly, what should I do?"
Zen master: "If you look ugly, you should be like me."
I nodded my head: "The mind is like still water, can I be alone?"
Zen master: "No, if you are ugly, you should hurry up and hide in a deep mountain like me."
