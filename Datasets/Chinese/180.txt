A girl usually speaks very "rough", and sometimes she will blurt out swear words, for example: carry grandma! (Taiwanese).
Once she called her friend Chunjiao, and the phone rang for a long time before someone answered.
As soon as this girl heard Chunjiao's voice, she immediately said, "Take grandma!"
In the end, only Chunjiao's voice came from the other end of the phone: "Mama! Your phone is here!"
