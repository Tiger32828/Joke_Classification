Dad was playing games with his five-year-old son. Dad suddenly thought of playing roles and told his son, "Come from now on, you will be a father and I will be a child."
The five-year-old son was very happy after hearing this. He clapped his hands and said yes, then immediately his face sank, and he pointed at the corner and said, "Go to the penalty stand!"
