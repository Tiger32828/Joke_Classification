The reporters rushed to the hospital after hearing the news. Later, when the doctor came out, the reporter hurriedly asked, "Doctor! Doctor! Is the president safe?"
The doctor shook his head in frustration and said, "Alas... the president is helpless..." The reporter asked again, "Doctor! Doctor! Is the vice president saved?"
The doctor shook his head in frustration and said, "Alas... it's not saved..." The reporter asked, "Then... who can be saved?"
The doctor was refreshed and said, "The country is saved!"
