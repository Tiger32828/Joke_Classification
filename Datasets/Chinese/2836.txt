When I was in elementary school, a teacher once said, "Remember to bring a rag tomorrow."
As a result, at night, I suddenly woke up from a dead sleep and found that I forgot to put the rag in my school bag.
In the dark, I groggyly threw the rag into my schoolbag and continued to sleep.
The next day, the teacher said, "Children, please put the rag on the table, the teacher wants to check."
Unexpectedly, when I took it out, it was actually a pair of underwear! The whole class laughed and my face turned green.
