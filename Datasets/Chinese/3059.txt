Zhuhati put some chickens in the cage and took them to the market to sell. He carried the chicken coop for a while and felt very tired.
Then he thought, "The chickens in the chicken coop may die of thirst or heat, why don't I let them go and drive them to the market?"
So he opened the chicken coop and let the chickens out, and the chickens flew in all directions and ran around, Zhuha carrying a stick and following behind a rooster,
As he ran, he complained, "You damn rooster, it's pitch black in the middle of the night, you can tell the dawn in the morning, but now it's broad daylight, but you don't know the way!"
