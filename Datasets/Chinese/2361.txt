Once, I took the express bus home, the air conditioner was running high, and the car was smooth and fast, so it was very comfortable, and the car full of men and women collapsed in their seats tiredly.
In a daze, everyone was woken up by a super poisonous and stinky fart; everyone frowned at first, and soon someone desperately covered their mouth and nose, when the concentration of the stinky fart became higher and higher,
The group started to riot and looked at each other viciously! Someone tried to open the window to breathe, only to find out in desperation that it was completely futile, because the window was airtight...
Everyone was pushing the limit of tolerance, and finally one student couldn't hold back and shouted, "Stop! I'm going down!"
The driver said: "Highway, can't stop!"
The student shouted again, "Please, I really can't hold back!"
The driver still ignored it.
Finally, the student roared, "Then I can't complain, there's going to be a loud noise!"
