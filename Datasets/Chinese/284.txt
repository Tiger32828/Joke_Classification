Today is Chinese New Year's Day. Xiao Ming was chatting with his friends on Facebook when he was suddenly called by his mother to go downstairs to burn paper money.
As soon as he came back, Xiao Ming's sister said to Xiao Ming, "Brother... Several people just came to wish you a happy birthday!"
Then Xiao Ming's sister said: "But you are burning paper money, so I will help you get them back! But... they are all offline~"
Xiao Ming thought it was very strange and looked at the record.

Talk to you from below..."
