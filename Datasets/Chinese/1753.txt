A physicist, a chemist, and a statistician were called to the dean's office, and they had just sat down to find a trash can on fire.
The physicist said: "I know how to reduce the temperature of the material below the flammable temperature, and the fire will naturally go out."
The chemist disagreed, "No, the supply of oxygen must be cut off first, and the fire will be extinguished without the reactants."
While the physicists and chemists were arguing, they were surprised to see the statisticians running around lighting one trash can after another.
"what are you doing?!"
The statistician replied, "I'm doing a sampling test!"
