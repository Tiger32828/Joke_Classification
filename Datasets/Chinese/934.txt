Every day, the girl would come to his shop to eat, sit by the window, and order two sets of meals.
Every time she asked how many people dined, she always shyly said, "two people"
But then he silently ate the two sets.
Maybe someone had been with the girl, he thought, but not anymore.
One day, he wanted to ask the girl's story, but he heard the girl mutter to herself:
"Damn it! Two servings are so small! I can't eat enough!"
