There was an emperor who loved to play the qin, but he played it so badly that the civil, military and concubines of the whole dynasty could not bear the sound of his qin.
The emperor searched the entire court, but could not find a bosom friend.
He sent an order to pull a death row prisoner from the dungeon.
The emperor promised: "As long as you say that the widow's harp plays well, I will spare you death."
Unexpectedly, the emperor's violin had just been played halfway, and the death row inmate cried out, "Your Majesty, please stop playing, I am willing to die!"
