There was a wooden man who was dating a girl for the first time in his life. After the meal, the two went to the mountain to watch the night view.
It didn't take long for the girl to say, "I feel a little cold."
Wooden man: "Then... do you want to wear my coat?"
Woman: "No! I'm afraid you'll be cold too."
Wooden man: "Then... what should I do? Do you want me to take you home?"
Woman: "No! It's not long since we came out, and it's still early."
Wooden man: "Then..."
Woman: "When I feel cold at home, my mother hugs me tightly."

Wooden man: "Then... do you want to call your mother?"
