Daming saw Xiaoyu standing by the lake with a mirror, Daming asked, "Xiaoyu, what are you doing there?"
Xiaoyu: "I'm fishing."
Da Ming: "Fishing with a mirror?"
Xiaoyu: "Yes, this is a new fishing method, and I'm about to make a fortune."
Daming: "Can you tell me this method?"
Xiaoyu: "Yes, I'll tell you if you give me 100 yuan." Da Ming paid the money obediently.
Xiaoyu: "Okay, the method is like this. You put the mirror on the water surface, and as soon as you see a fish swimming by, use the reflection of the mirror to scare it. If the fish is frightened, you can pick it up."
Daming: "Nonsense, how can you catch fish like this. How many have you caught?"
Xiaoyu: "Today you are the fifth."
