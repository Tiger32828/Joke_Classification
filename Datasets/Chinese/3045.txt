One day, Mayakovsky saw a woman in a small hat on the road. She gathered a lot of people around her and used all kinds of the most ridiculous rumors to slander and slander the Bolsheviks (1903 AD). In 1917, the Social Democratic Party headed by Lenin advocated the dictatorship of the proletariat, and in 1917, after the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, it was renamed the Communist Party).

Mayakovsky was very angry, and immediately separated the crowd with strong hands,
He went straight to the woman and said, "Catch her, she stole my purse yesterday!"
The woman panicked and muttered vaguely: "Are you mistaken?" "No, no, it was you who stole 25 rubles from me."
The people surrounding the woman began to laugh at her and walked away.
After the people were gone, the woman said to him with tears and snot: "My God, look at me, I really saw you for the first time!"
Mayakovsky replied: "Isn't it? Madam, this is the first time you have seen a Bolshevik, talking about Bolsheviks..."
