In the psychiatrist's clinic.
A man: "Frightened me! Frightened me! Doctor, I had a nightmare last night that scared me half to death."
Doctor: "Don't be afraid, what exactly are you dreaming about?"
A man: "In my dream, my wife and a young, beautiful woman with a hot body were fighting and jealous because of me!"
Doctor: "How can this kind of thing scare you like encountering a demon?"
A man: "Doctor, you haven't listened to me yet! It turned out that my wife won the fight"
