- Sergei Kuzhugetovich, as you wish, but on May 9 our tanks parade along Khreshchatyk. - Vladimir Vladimirovich, I'm afraid that if we hurry, there will be no tanks left for the parade. - Is it possible to make it in time by May 9, and the tanks remain? - It is possible. But then there will be no Khreshchatyk.
