The doctor recently wrote me two pieces of paper - one for me, the second for the pharmacy. So the one that reads perfectly for me, the handwriting is a solid "four", even by the standards of a strict elementary school teacher. And for the pharmacy - some kind of cardiogram ... But the pharmacy understood everything without question and gave out exactly what was written out. Maybe this is how they add a digital signature?
