ALTERNATIVE OLD TESTAMENT The speech of "Moses" But in principle, Pharaoh can be understood. He strove for the best, for peace and prosperity. He wanted us to be more productive. After all, our work is a strong army, and our food, and clothing. Yes, there were cruel measures, of course forced. But what to do if the saboteurs, at the instigation of the Hittites, rocked the boat of Ra, the faith and way of life of their ancestors. Without us, Egypt will face famine, enemies and disaster. Who is sure that all these ten plagues of Egypt were for our good, and not arranged by the Hittites in order to undermine the power and authority of Egypt? Yes, and to the promised land we go not yet eighteen years. I suggest we go back while we're not far away. We are waiting for a variety of native stews instead of boring, unhealthy manna, wheat beer on weekends, stability and guaranteed jobs. There will be equality again, without the rich and smart scribes. And with the gold we have accumulated from the golden calf, Egypt is not afraid of any enemy sanctions.
