Sometimes I show Comedy to myself: Karabas-Barabas - KharlamovBuratino - Dimka Grachev Karabas-Barabas collects dolls in a chest, with a mysterious EU inscription, and says: - Come on, come on, you are stoned, bayu-bayu-bayu .... and I I'll take a nap ... - and passes out in the chair. A whip in the form of a pack of "bucks" limply hung in his hand. Here, from behind the scenes in a dark blue suit, with an Italian tie against a spotless white shirt, comes out: - BU!-tadatatata-RA!-tadatatata-TI!-tadatatata-NO!, BU-RA-TI-NO .. .. and the whole auditorium froze in anticipation - who wins, and what other trick will a daring boy with a "wooden" ruble allow himself to do? I did not see further. Watch "Pinocchio-3".
