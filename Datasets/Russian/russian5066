I don't understand why everyone is whining. Personally, everything is fine with me and my friends too. I am a pensioner, but I do not sit at home, but continue to work and earn. The daughters are already adults, they are engaged in business and very successfully. You just need to work better, not whine. Start with yourself!Vladimir P, 69, Moscow
