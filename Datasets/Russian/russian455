A jazz pianist was once invited to a classical orchestra, which was left without a soloist. The conductor, aware of the reputation of jazz musicians, was surprised that he showed up at all. However, his eyes popped out of his head when the pianist in the first part played Stravinsky absolutely perfectly, and pointed out mistakes in the notes. During the intermission, the conductor went to express his admiration: — I must admit, I heard a lot of criticism of jazz musicians, I was hostile towards you, but what you did completely satisfies my ideas of professionalism! Please accept my apologies! — Come on, dude! By the way, I forgot to say: I have another hack today, so my replacement will come now.
