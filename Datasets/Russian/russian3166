Some kind of duality has set in in the brains... Here, for example: in the West, yachts are confiscated from our... uh... oligarchs, yes. And well, on the one hand, so they scoundrels! And, on the other hand, it's our money that goes to the budgets of Western "democracies" ... Or here: the State Duma proposed sending participants in illegal rallies to the Donbass, to the war zone. And again: it seems that he himself is against ... uh ... operations, yes; and, on the other hand, it would be very worthwhile to send these revolutionaries there, to communicate with "Ukrainian patriots offended by Russia" ... Dually, yeah ... How is it with Shakespeare - "A plague on both your houses", right?
