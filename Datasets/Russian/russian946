The EU has announced a ban on the use of the letters Z and V in business correspondence in protest against Russian aggression in Ukraine. According to the President of the European Commission, the transition to a new version of the Latin alphabet can be carried out before the end of this year. The possibility of replacing the letters Z and V with symbols from other alphabets is also considered.
