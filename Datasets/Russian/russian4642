I want to point out right away. Not mine. A friend from Asia sent. Google translate. Just like we have Ajit and Rajnikanth jokes, in Russia there are jokes about Putin..... When Putin was late for school, the teacher punished the whole class for coming early. When the phone rings in the cinema Putin, the film is paused. Doctor: "You have cancer." Putin: "Tell him he has two weeks left to live." When Putin looks in the mirror, there is no reflection because there is only 1 Putin. When Putin was born, he named his parents. Russia did not choose him, he chose Russia. Putin arrives to the airport of a foreign country:Customs officer: "Profession?" Putin: No, just visiting. Putin calls 911 to ask what happened to them. Putin built the hospital where he was born. This guy never flushes the toilet, he just scares the hell out of him. Putin, he slapped the doctor for not crying. When Putin didn't go to school, the school declared it a Holiday. Stop calling him the Russian James Bond. James Bond is the British Vladimir Putin. When Putin creates an account, the terms and conditions are consistent with him. When Putin coughs, Covid puts on a mask.
