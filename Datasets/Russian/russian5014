The Russian national hockey team lost in overtime to the Czech national team. Yes, guys, things wonâ€™t work like that - ahead of the meeting with the Canadians, the Finns, with Sweden and the USA. It became quite obvious that we could not do without a super-duper striker who scores 10-15 goals per match. You understand what I mean. Get him on the team! Enough for him to sit in the bunker!
