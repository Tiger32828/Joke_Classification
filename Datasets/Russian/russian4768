A good trader knows in advance what he will do when the price goes “wrong”. A bad trader does not know in advance what he will do, he thinks that when the price goes “wrong”, then he will decide, but right now there is nothing to rack his brains .A very bad trader knows for sure that the price will never go wrong.
