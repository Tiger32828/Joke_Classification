Judging by the duration of Russian TV broadcasts from the Beijing Olympics, curling is the most sought-after and popular sport in Russia. Several hours a day on 3 different channels transmit this breathtaking spectacle. Why should we show some boring competitions in alpine skiing, snowboarding or ski acrobatics? It is much more interesting to watch how several people slowly exchange opinions on the ice where to put the next stone, try on for the next action, the involved personalities can also participate in open debates, then the stone slowly goes to the intended place, accompanied by accelerating shouts "closer", "more left", " to the right", etc. , more and more accelerating convulsive movements of the mop begin, and finally the final cry of satisfaction or disappointment. Then everything repeats. Maybe the attraction of the spectacle for broadcast editors lies in the fact that it vaguely resembles some kind of perverted sex?
