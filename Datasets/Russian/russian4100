- Girls, as a man I tell you: stop hammering into your head that as long as you do not look like models from the covers, we will not want you. When a man is in bed with you, he does not care at all about your winning angles, about the fact that your chest is somehow not of such a shape or your tummy is visible. Especially when they tell you they love you! Love not for boobs or even eyebrows! And certainly no one will start packing if you have "oh-god-plus-kilogram". Well, got it, seriously!
