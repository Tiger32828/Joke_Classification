A new feature for visitors to Moscow. They go shopping and see what is not there. There is sugar, there is buckwheat, there is jasmine rice, there is rice for pilaf, there is vodka, there is trophy Ukrainian. Ah, there you are! Sugar then you have 70, and we had 60. That's what you bastards need. I'll go to the nearby Magnet and see if there's anything there.
