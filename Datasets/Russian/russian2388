- Tell me, Holmes, here you are catching a dangerous criminal. A youth of 15 years old runs out at you and aims at you from a revolver. What will you do? First: ask him if he is 18 years old? Second: start persuading him not to do this. Third, shoot ahead of time? - "Elementary, Watson! Neither one nor the other nor the third! I'll pinch myself harder - this can only be dreamed of in a nightmare!"
