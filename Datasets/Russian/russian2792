Here are various propagandists who think and even write smart books about how to rally the people. They say we need victories, faith in a wise leader and awareness of one's exclusivity ... Do you know what really rallied the Russians most of all in recent days? The arrest in Italy of two villas of Solovyov. This is exactly the issue on which everyone was absolutely in solidarity, well, except for Solovyov himself. ;)
