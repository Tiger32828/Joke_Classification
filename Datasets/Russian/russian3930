We come to a colleague, a certain Ivan Sidorov or Sidor Ivanov, I don’t remember exactly, the head of the tax inspectorate of one region. For some reason, a portrait of a pretty brunette hung on the wall in his office. - Why does the head of the tax inspectorate have a portrait of a woman hanging on the wall in his office? - I ask in the tone of a boss. - And this is a portrait of my wife, ordered from a well-known artist in the region, - either Ivan or Sidor answered proudly. - Why not a portrait of the head of the region, - my visiting colleague asked, laughing, - after all, all normal bosses have a portrait of either the President or the head of the region in their office? - And my wife is also the head of the region, - answered either Sidorov, or Ivanov with a smile, - didn’t you know?
