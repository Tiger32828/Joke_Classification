For the first time, I like Western sanctions so much: the stage has been cleared of slag, you no longer need to remember the password for Instagram and Facebook, the IQ of children has gone up sharply, Indian films will soon return, various minecraft and amongas will stop working, as well as their cheaters on YouTube. The West has made an invaluable contribution to the fight against corruption. Western liberal media have lost their websites and now they can only yell into the void from their radio stations. Oil, the price for which the West tried to ruin Russia, can soar above $ 300 per barrel (Arab princes are sorting out their rosary with a smile). Oral sex will again be for love, not for iApple.
