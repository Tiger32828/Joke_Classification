Dear readers, There was a mistake in yesterday's issue of our newspaper. The caption "I will reduce your medical expenses" was supposed to be placed under the photo of the presidential candidate, and "This vegetable will change your life" under the advertisement of the greengrocer's products. The proofreader was reprimanded and paid a bonus for his contribution to an unprecedented increase in sales.
