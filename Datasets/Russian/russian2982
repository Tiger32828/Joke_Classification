An elderly Jew is called by his son: - Dad, dad! In connection with these events, my family and I do not fly to Italy, I postponed the purchase of a new car, it’s good that I didn’t have time to sell a seven-year Kruzak. And the worst thing: we are moving from the penthouse tomorrow to our old kopeck piece. Dad, this is a disaster! - Son, a disaster is when there is no food and a roof over your head. And all that you have listed is inconvenience.
