- Do you know, Semyon Markovich, what our political experts said on TV yesterday? They said that NATO was going to attack us. Is this really true? - Oh, Sarah! My heart has been aching for a long time from these experts, and yesterday I again watched the Zoo TV channel - about the bottom fish "small-eyed grenadier". But I'll tell you that I would immediately turn off the TV if this fish began to talk about the habits of golden eagles.
