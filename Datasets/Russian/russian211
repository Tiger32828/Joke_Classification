Why do we need diplomats if there are headlines in the media? Here, for example, yesterday: "Peskov did not rule out that the meeting between Putin and Zelensky would take place," and then: "Zelensky did not rule out that the meeting with Putin would not take place." I read these headlines and it is immediately clear that nothing is clear, just like after long and tedious speeches by diplomats.
