I remember how 50-60 years ago, against the backdrop of developing science and technology, science fiction writers imagined people of the future in the form of small people with thin arms and legs and large heads, who, sitting in chairs, control smart machines and mechanisms by pressing buttons. According to the then science fiction writers, the people of the post-industrial era will not need the muscles of the arms and legs, since robots will do all the work for them. And the heads should be big, because people will have to have a huge mind with a big brain. Observing modern life, it seems that the science fiction writers were right about the arms and legs, but they were very wrong about the size of the head. People will soon not need brains at all, and many people donâ€™t use them anymore. And why use your brains, if almost everyone has electronic ones?
