Girl to the doctor: How did "everything" turn out to be torn? In the stable I dropped my brooch, bent down to pick it up, I feel: someone loves me. I think it's okay, again a stallion. But I feel like I'm starting to tear up. There is no such stallion in this stable! I look around, look and see: Lieutenant Rzhevsky.
