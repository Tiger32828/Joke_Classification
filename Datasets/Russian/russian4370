Summer morning. Panas: where is he, where did he go? Hey Panas! He turns and sees his friend Mikola running towards him at full speed. Panas, you won't believe it, I just saw the general. Mikola, have you drunk vodka? I didn't drink anything, I tell you Panas, I saw the general. What general? Yes, our main Zaluzhny near the lake. And he didn't shoot you, Mikola? Yes, why shoot at me, Panas. But he would take you, Mikola, for a sepor and shoot you. Listen Panas, do you really believe that they are sepors? I believe, I don’t believe, but I’m ordered to believe, Mikola, it’s safer that way. Hey Panas, let's go and have a look at the general. Well, let's go. They come to the lake, and the shore is overgrown with bushes and nothing is visible, but only splashes of water are heard. They approached the bushes and Panas carefully parted the branches of the bush and looked in. Ba, he said, so this is my boar. Boar? asked Mikola. Yes, a boar, said Panas, I've been looking for him all morning, but it turns out he ran away to the lake. Listen, Mikola, how did you manage to confuse my boar with General Zaluzny? It was so far away, and look for yourself: he is the same pink bald and muzzled, just one face.
