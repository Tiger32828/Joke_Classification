A very short anecdote. Russia continues to fulfill its obligations to supply oil and gas to Europe. And she gets paid somehow. But it is impossible to buy something with these payments in the same Europe because of the sanctions. That is, they pay for gas with air. Well, yes, this is also gas, so the exchange is equivalent.
