Appeal of EU members to the President of the United States: - We are concerned about the information that has appeared about biolaboratories in Ukraine. COVID-19 has shown that our hospitals are not at all ready for a new pandemic! - Friends, don’t worry about the Ukrainians, in short, you won’t need hospitals.
