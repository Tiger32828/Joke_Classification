The realities of a hybrid war: contractors from the 810th Separate Marine Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet called one of the restaurants on Khreshchatyk and booked a table for February 23.

The Kiev authorities are trying to drive a wedge between the Russians and the Buryats in order to undermine their friendship and military camaraderie!
