The prima donna is a tiger who silently watches from above the fight between monkeys and monkeys. Her silence is more eloquent than any words. The departure of the Diva from the country is perceived as a very loud, deafening statement about everything that is happening, and anyone with a head on their shoulders will understand this. It was not she who left the country, this country was left without a Prima Donna.
