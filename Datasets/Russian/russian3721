- Hello, Doctor! How are my results? What are the predictions? Speak as you are. - Unfortunately, I do not have good news for you. Brain cancer in the terminal stage, numerous metastases. - And how much do I have left? - Six months, a year maximum. Spend them so as not to regret. Spread your wings, don't worry about the consequences. Now you can do everything. - Yes, doctor, thank you for your frankness. I will think. I have interesting ideas. All the best. - Goodbye, Vladimir Vladimirovich
