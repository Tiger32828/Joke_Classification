In my childhood in kindergarten - the kids constantly yelled, took away my toys - I gave them away - I don’t feel sorry, they complained to the teacher that I hit them, although I tried not to touch them at all and avoided violent ... Despite the presence of pots, some preferred to shit in your pants and pissing past the potty… Now I’m looking at the world community – damn it!… NOTHING HAS CHANGED SINCE KINDERGARTEN!!!
