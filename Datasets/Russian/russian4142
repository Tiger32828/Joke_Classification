A nice bonus - to meet Lavrov with Blinkin in Geneva, it is not at all necessary to rent a luxury hotel or villa in the city, it is enough to rent an apartment in a prestigious residential complex of the current president of Kazakhstan, since he has enough living quarters there to receive state delegations. Again, money for renting apartments will go to the treasury of Kazakhstan.
