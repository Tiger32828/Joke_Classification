From the wise thoughts of the cat Semyon: - You can enter the same tray twice. - If you look at the hostess for a long time and yell heart-rendingly, you can see how she goes to pour food into the bowl. - If you carry dead mice on the threshold of the house for a long time, you can hear how heart-rendingly the hostess yells. — Why do you want to eat so much at night? — Not a single dog knows how to achieve its own. — The owners’ muzzles are designed to walk on them at 6 o’clock in the morning. .- A trash bag is a cat's best friend.- The dog knows where the owners hide the sausage!- Leaves and burdock, brought to the apartment on the tail and neatly scattered on the floor, decorate the interior very much.- The one who thinks that there is nothing in an empty box - moron. It has a cat in it. — A real cat always rattles a Harley Davidson. You need to think for another three or four minutes. — The hostess can be easily distracted from reading by hanging on the curtain at ease. — The purpose of a cat’s life is to find out what is in the washing machine. end unexpectedly, leave proudly, because "why is she bothering"? - The owners are not capable of madness. They don't jump at each other from the closet. "The hosts are boring as dead mice." It never occurs to them to jump at night. - The owners hunt somewhere for ten hours a day, but they have never brought home a single bird. - I wonder if the owners are castrated too? , and that stupid one ... :-)
