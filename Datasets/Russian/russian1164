Having received a pension in the post office, all upset, Gena the crocodile returned home. He went into the room to the bookcase and began leafing through some book: "Chebureks ... Humans ... Churchkhela ... Chechil cheese ..." - Gen, are you looking at the Encyclopedia again? We found out that I was not there, - Cheburashka remarked timidly. - No, Cheburashka. This is me watching the crocodile "The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food". Well, I don't eat you raw. Still, we have known each other for so many years, - Gena admitted with tears in his eyes.
