UN meeting. On the podium, Nebenzya is a representative of Russia: - Russia is bringing a lawsuit against Ukraine for one hundred and twenty-five million dollars. This is the debt itself with 1044 years of interest. The debt was formed as a result of the fact that the Ukrainians stole a horse from the Russian hero Ilya Muromets, who arrived in Kyiv. Kislytsya, a representative of Ukraine, breaks down: - This is a lie! There could not have been any Ukrainians in Kyiv then, they simply did not exist!!! Nebenzya: - That's what I'm talking about.
