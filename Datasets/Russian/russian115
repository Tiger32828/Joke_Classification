As children, my brother and I played with money. The money was candy wrappers. We used them to buy things from each other. Over time, as a result of various exchanges, almost all the candy wrappers ended up with me. But I did not enjoy this wealth for long. My brother simply refused to sell me anything for my candy wrappers. When buying cryptocurrency, remember that no one is obligated to buy it from you later.
