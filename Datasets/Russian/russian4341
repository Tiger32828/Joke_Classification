- Why the oppositionists are recognized as either foreign agents or extremists. But never at the same time? - Yes, it's elementary. Here's a person who received $50 from Google for advertising on the blog. And then he was declared an extremist for the content of the blog and a foreign agent for these $50 from Google. It turns out that Google is financing extremism, and this is already multi-billion dollar losses for the corporation. Google will not spare any money for lawyers for the chela.
