A successful business project in Primorye turned out! 1. We give, as it were, a free Far Eastern hectare for 5 years.2. We are waiting for a road to be led to it and a house to be built.3. For months we have been “tolerating” the paperwork and after 5 years we squeeze the entire object from them as “not used for its intended purpose”!
