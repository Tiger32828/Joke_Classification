- Imagine what would happen if Russia made peace with Europe and even fully integrated with it. The enemy that threatens the security of the EU immediately disappears, that is, Europe no longer needs the US and NATO military umbrella, receives endless inexpensive sources of raw materials, and becomes a world economic leader.
