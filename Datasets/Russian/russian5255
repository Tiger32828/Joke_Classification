Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, commenting on the talks with British Foreign Minister Liz Truss, said: “We seem to be listening, but we don’t hear. At the very least, our most detailed explanations fell on unprepared ground, in much the same way as they say that Russia is waiting for the ground to freeze and become like a stone so that the tanks can calmly pass into Ukrainian territory. It seems to me that our British colleagues had the same ground today, on which they lay down and from which the numerous facts that we cited bounced off. Damn, someone sane, finally explain to the minister that the formula DLB BPD is a shorter form of expressing the same meaning.
