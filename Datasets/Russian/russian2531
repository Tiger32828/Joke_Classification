It was decided to leave one IKEA and one McDonald's in its original, unlooted form and give it the status of a museum and cultural heritage. It is planned to organize paid excursions of citizens there as part of domestic tourism under the program "In Search of the Lost" and "Secrets of the Lost Civilization".
