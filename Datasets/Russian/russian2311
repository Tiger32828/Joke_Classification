In response to the sanctions and the cessation of the supply of auto components, Russia has developed a new car model - SputnikZ. The symbol Z in the brand means Zero, that is, zero equipment. The model is being finalized to the "Comfort" package with the installation of the Belarusian split system. The location of the external unit causes difficulties for the designers - on the roof it upsets the balance of the car, and on the trunk it blocks the rear view.
