Stopped today by a traffic cop in the morning. Immediately asks: - How are you feeling? I say: - Mediocre. He immediately squinted: - What's the matter? Did you drink yesterday? - No, - I say, - the international geopolitical situation is just very disturbing. - So, - he says, - let's go to my car and discuss the international situation there. We sat down, he collects a breathalyzer there. He asks: - So what is the situation there? I say: - Terrorism is going through the roof. Russia is ignored in the international arena. Children in Ethiopia are starving. There are political prisoners in Belarus, Kadyrov in Russia. - Breathe until the end of the beep. Breathe. The inspector looks at the device for a long time. Then he gives me the rights. He says: - Well, Vladislav Sergeevich. Thank you for your sober assessment of the geopolitical situation in the world. Lucky road.
