A task from a school physics course: Gas in Europe is traded at a record high above $3,000 per 1 ton m3, the dollar on the Forex market has reached historical highs of $137/ruble. Accordingly, the price of the market quotation of Russian gas in rubles has reached a historical super-maximum. Question: at what levels, according to the aphorism of Mendeleev, in Russia it will become more profitable to heat not with gas, but with ruble banknotes?
