Two old cowboy buddies, Bill and Joe, meet in a saloon one day. The conversation turns to politics. Joe asks: - Bill, buddy, you graduated from university, now you own your old ranch, and bought a few hundred more, you participate in auctions on Wall Street. Can you explain to me, a redneck with one ranch, what is this "geopolitics" that everyone is talking about? - Okay. Let's take your ranch as an example. Are you doing well? Are you friends with your neighbors? - Well, yes, the income is stable, better than most neighbors. I'm friends with my neighbors, once a month we arrange races and a picnic together. - Do you want to get rich quick and become famous? - Not really, but let's say. - Well, you decided to get rich quick. Bought weapons, hired the fastest shooters. You go up to one neighbor with shooters, point guns at him, and you’re like, “Hi, John! I have a great offer for you: either you give me the ranch right now, or I’ll take it anyway!” Naturally, John gives you the ranch. You do the same with all your neighbors, and move forward as long as you have enough money for weapons and shooters ... - But Bill, you can't! How am I going to arrange races and picnics with my neighbors, they will hate me and shy away from me! I myself will either walk with my shooters and seize the ranch, or sit locked in the cellar, fearing the revenge of my former friends! What the fuck is that, Bill! - That's it, Joe. But your geopolitical position will be wonderful!
