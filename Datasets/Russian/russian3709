- What is the difference between democracy and legitimate government from the junta and the "regime"? - It's elementary! If you rewrite the constitution for yourself by increasing the number of terms, remove or imprison real competitors or create serious problems for them, suspiciously win electronic voting, hold voting for 3 days on stumps and in trunks, ignore the stuffing videos circulating on the network, then this is legal government. And if you just put up your candidacy for elections and win because the people voted that way, then this is a junta. - And what to do with this accursed junta? - Well ... you can ask the military to storm the presidential office, forcibly remove the president elected by the people and take power into their own hands. Then it will also be a legitimate government.
