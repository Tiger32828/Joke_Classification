A London police spokesman told reporters that a bottle of Molotov cocktail had been thrown into Roman Abramovich's office. However, the Russian oligarch managed to quickly leave the premises through the window and was not injured. Abramovich's office is located on the eighth floor of a building in London's Soho business centre.
