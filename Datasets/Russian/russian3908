In the US, there is no age limit for driving a car. A deaf old woman is driving, her husband is in the passenger seat (he hears better). They are stopped by a policeman: - You have exceeded the speed limit! Old woman: - What did he say? Husband: - You exceeded the speed limit! Policeman: - Your rights! - What did he say? - Give him your rights! The policeman opens the rights: - Oh, are you from Arkansas? I was there, I was, and I had the most disgusting sex in my life there! Old woman: - What did he say? Husband: - He said that he knows you!
