Tonight, fierce fighting was going on in Kyiv, bullets were whistling, grenades were exploding and javelins were being used. In the morning it turned out that the Armed Forces of Ukraine wanted to rob the store, which had already been robbed by the teroborona. There were no such fierce battles even in the Donbass.
