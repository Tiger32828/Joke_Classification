- You see, consciousness is just a probabilistic wave in Minkowski space, just a coherent stream of entangled particles of intelligence from a boson to networks of galaxies that believe in the inviolability of physical constants and laws common to them, which in fact are just a route on the surface of an isometric cone given by a particle of the Observer that gave birth to them all, every moment destroying and creating the Universe by the very fact of observation! won't dig. So stop talking nonsense and go to work!
