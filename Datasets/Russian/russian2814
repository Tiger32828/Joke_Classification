In response to Russia's actions in Ukraine, Europe: 1) Rejected freedom of speech and related human rights 2) Introduced discrimination based on nationality 3) Introduced tribal law, when all members of the tribe are responsible for some actions of representatives of the tribe, without trial or investigation, regardless of personal participation, personal guilt and the ability to influence the situation How quickly, however, people give up their principles on emotions ... I wonder if Europe understands that their new tribal law justifies American policemen, just in case they shot blacks to kill?
