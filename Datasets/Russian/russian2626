I have a question: What does the sixth-class welder Petrov (a resident of Pskov) do wrong (when he connects metal parts by welding), in contrast to the sixth-class welder Ivanov (a resident of Moscow, who connects metal parts by welding) - what Petrov's salary is ten times less than Ivanov's salary, and the level of life satisfaction is a hundred times lower?
