Stephen King banned the sale of his books in Russia because of the horrors in Ukraine. By the same logic, he should have banned the sale of his books at home: - in 1999 because of the horrors in Yugoslavia; - from 2001 to 2014. because of the horrors in Afghanistan; - in 2003 because of the horrors in Iraq; - in 2011 because of the horrors in Libya; - in 2014 because of the horrors in Syria; - in 2015 because of the horrors in Yemen and Cameroon.
