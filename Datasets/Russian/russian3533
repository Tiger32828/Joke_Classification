If anything, the United States resets its debts, Russia begins to trade exclusively in rubles. Mutual profit. Airbuses are already being withdrawn from Russia, while Boeings remain. Who benefits? Russia and the USA are the largest exporters of hydrocarbons, prices are going up against the backdrop of the war. Who is happy again? Europe, having stopped flying through Russia, is losing fuel and money, the Americans continue to fly .... Am I the only one tormented by vague suspicions? :)
