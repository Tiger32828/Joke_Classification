Correspondence of a girl with a guy: - Maxim, it seems to me that you need to grow long hair ... - You used to say that I was shaggy, and when I found a hairdresser with golden hands, you say that I donâ€™t need to get a haircut. - I found out that your hairdresser not only has golden hands, but also a chest of the fourth size!
