A waiter and an OBKhSS inspector lived on the same landing. And whenever they met, the waiter always greeted the neighbor in the same way: "Good evening." For some time, the inspector endured, but finally could not stand it and asked: - Sorry, we have been living nearby for a long time, and you constantly greet me with the words "good evening", regardless of whether it is morning, afternoon or deep night. Are you kidding me, taking me for a complete idiot? - No, what are you, - answered the pale worker of the tray and towel, - it's just that when I see you, it gets dark in my eyes.
