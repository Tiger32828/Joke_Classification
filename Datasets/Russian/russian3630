American journalist Matthew Chance of CNN is reporting live from the Gostomel military airfield near Kiev (this was true in reality!). And in broken Russian he interviews the military, they tell him: - We just recaptured the airfield! - Who controls everything here now? the journalist asks. “The Russians are in control.” “Okay, so where are the Russians then?” - the journalist is surprised. - So we are Russians!
