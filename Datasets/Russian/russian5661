In view of the frequent collapse of the roof of newly built buildings, I propose to declare the works of Newton, Bernoulli, Galileo, Hooke extremist and continue to ban their use on the territory of the Russian Federation. It should also be prohibited to exceed the daily rainfall in winter, so as not to create a burden on municipal services.
