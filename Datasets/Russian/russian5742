It always amuses me when one of the competitors sends you a commercial offer, indicating all their customers as addressees. But there are incidents! I don't want to discredit this supplier, but, as they say, you can't throw words out of a song. We get another newsletter, with a bunch of additional Recipients, and an offer to buy their finishing material. We get it okay. Thank you! But then a letter arrives from one of the "happy customers" who was in this mailing list. And there: “Dear businessmen, don’t buy anything from these scammers. They delivered a machine of defective material to us, we sued them for 1.5 years. , but it's still the same lying muzzle. I'm giving a link to our lawsuit so that you can see the true face of this "business" and not get into a mess like we do. Sincerely, Name Patronymic, chief accountant of Xxxx LLC tel xxxxxxxxxxxxx" In general, as they say, the ad did not go))
