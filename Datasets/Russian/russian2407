The sanctions imposed against members of the family of Dmitry Peskov turned out to be not so "hellish" anymore. They concern the wife and adult children of the press secretary, but they say nothing about a cat and two hamsters living in the family. Apparently, restrictions on them will be imposed in the new sanctions package, which is currently being prepared at the US State Department.
