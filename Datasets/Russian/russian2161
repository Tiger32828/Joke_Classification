The other day I saw a piece of a Turkish series: - Honey, I'm going home, what can I buy in the store? - Honey, I don't know ... Well, buy sugar. - I recently bought sugar. Are you secretly feeding a horse from me? Well, now at least I understand why there is no sugar in stores. Each of us must feed the horse.
