- Where do men get lipstick marks on their bodies? - To answer this question, you need to turn to physiologists. Not all women know that a man's skin has memory. She remembers everything that happened in the childhood of a man (especially in infancy). Mommy kisses a little man in all places. And now, years later - perhaps as a result of stress or a corporate party - the skin suddenly remembers such kisses, and the so-called kissing stigmata appear on the male body. And the fact that these traces are multi-colored and smell like women's lipstick is all to blame for the unusual local pigmentation and the work of some kind of glands.
