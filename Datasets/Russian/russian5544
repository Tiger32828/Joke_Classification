I remember very well how I went to vote with my father in the mid-80s, I was 10 years old. The man who gave out the ballot carefully wrote the number of the apartment where we lived on it with a pen. I tug on my father’s sleeve and say “This is not legal!”, he says “quietly, it’s necessary, this is a scoop”.
