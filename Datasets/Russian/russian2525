The king had two nine-year-old daughters, and he wanted to know if they were virgins. He went to the sorcerer and asked: - How can I find out if my daughters are virgins? - Come and ask them about it, if they lie, they will immediately turn to stone. The king approaches his eldest daughter and asks her: - Tell me, daughter, the truth, are you a virgin? “Yes,” the daughter replies. And a stone stands in front of the king. The king approaches his youngest daughter and asks her: - Tell me, daughter, the truth, are you a virgin? - Yes, - the daughter answers. And a stone stands in front of the king. Time has passed. The king became sad without his daughters, he went back to the sorcerer and asked him: - How can I turn my daughters back into people? - If at least one virgin passes between two stone blocks, they will come to life, - the sorcerer answered. So there are two stone columns at the entrance to the Faculty of Journalism of Moscow State University!
