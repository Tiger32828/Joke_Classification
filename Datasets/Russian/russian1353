One weekend a man came with his sons of student age from the city to the village to visit his mother. A few hours after her arrival, the woman decided to ask her son for help: “Please do me a few small repairs at home,” the woman says. mother. - Help me, please, plant something in the garden, prepare something, - the woman asks her grandchildren. - We, too, probably next time, but now we will train for the army, and maybe even for war. .. - the grandchildren answer. Here is another example of the poor upbringing of men in childhood and its consequences. If from childhood they were taught to do more useful things inside and around their home especially, to value their own and other people's work, too, than to play war games and learn to shoot in order to cripple or even destroy the personal property of all innocent people. And wars will completely cease to occur only when only women manage and engage in the development of cities, especially countries in general. Only women will worry a little about food production and rural development, but not about the development of the army, especially weapons to the detriment of our planet Earth, as men mostly do.
