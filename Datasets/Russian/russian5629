The problem with stray packs of aggressive dogs is solved simply and effectively - shooting and euthanasia are not needed! Captured dogs are kept for one month at overexposure, those who will be taken away must be chipped + GPS for tracking. If they end up on the street again - the maximum fine is 100,500 thousand for the owners. All stray dogs not taken by people are packed into cages and parachuted by helicopters of the Ministry of Emergencies beyond the Arctic Circle (hurry up, while it's winter), for example, to the Dyatlov Pass!
