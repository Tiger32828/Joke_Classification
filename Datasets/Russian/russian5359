Those who believe that we are rolling into the Middle Ages are mistaken. In the Middle Ages, Russian merchants came to overseas lands, looked at how beautiful and fine they were, and thought that they should do the same for themselves. This is how many historical monuments appeared. The current figures, coming to overseas lands and seeing how good it is there, think they should bring their relatives here.
