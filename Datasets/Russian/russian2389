Newspaper "Novosti Zazhopinska" for March 2022. The head physician of the psycho-neurological boarding house #64 in the city of Zazzhopinska announced to his wards that they would all be transferred tomorrow to the city of Nice on the Cote d'Azur and each of them would be given a mileen. Therefore, it is urgent to demolish their current boarding house so that no one changes their mind. When the joyful psychos messed up their house, it turned out that the head physician was joking like that. And he wasn't even a leader. And he was a clown from a traveling circus.
