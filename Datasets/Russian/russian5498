In vain, everyone scares Orwell for "1984". It was long ago replaced by Bulgakov's "Master and Margarita". Don't you believe it? Read the news: - Azazello promised Berlioz to cut off his head - The bassoon is carrying another blizzard - A talking cat with an iPad in its paws sits on the security council - Margarita flies to the Sabbath - Gella has a pool with an aqua disco - well, and the Master, of course, is sitting behind bars And where are we in this play, you ask? We answer - you sing in chorus.
