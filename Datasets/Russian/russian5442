Vovochka in the Soviet Union came to school with Pepsi. A classmate was surprised and asked: -How did you get it? - At the post office. A classmate went to the post office and, no matter how he asked or begged, they didn’t give him Pepsi. - You divorced me - says the next day a classmate Vovochka. - You don’t understand anything. My dad works at the post office. That's where I got it.
