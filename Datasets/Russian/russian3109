The near future, both of them are fucking sad Scholz and Macron: - Do you remember, Olaf, how good we lived before? - I remember, Manu. - We bought cheap gas from the Russians, and they immediately spent the received gas on holidays on the Cote d'Azur and the purchase of our securities, and the money did not leave home? - So it was, Manu ... - And now we first buy dollars from the Americans, so that later we can buy gas from them at exorbitant prices, and we live badly! - Bad, Manu! - Olaf, don't you think that the Americans constantly give us a little bit of a f@ck?!
