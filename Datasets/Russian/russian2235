From the history of the XXI century: TV presenter: Hello dear viewers, dear music lovers. Today in the program "Forgotten Melodies" performed by maestro Valery Gergiev will sound "The Crunch of a French Bread". I'll tell you a secret that the maestro has been intensively rehearsing for the last two weeks, trying not to part with this melody even for a second. Even going to bed, he preferred not his wife in bed, but a pair of fervent, ruddy, appetizing buns. So, listen: The melody begins with a light packing Andante. We see how masterfully with his quivering fingers the maestro extracts a marzipan bun from a shiny cellophane. And then the melody turns into the languid sounds of moderato champing Allegro. Now half of the muffin is gone and the marzipan Khrushendo glorioso sounds triumphant, interrupted by light Staccato of crushed candied nuts. A moment, and the melody ends with a delicious Rygatto apotheoso, giving the whole world the trumpet angelic sound of a snickering womb. Final. Bravo maestro, bravo! We remind you that next week on the air of "Forgotten Melodies" will sound "The first sound of hissing bubbles from a popped can of Coca-Cola". We are waiting for you on our Only First Channel or how fashionable it is now for young people to say "meet me at EPK".
