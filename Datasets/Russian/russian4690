A very elite gated community on Rublyovka. Under the house of academician Gunzburg there is a column of continuously honking black jeeps and a crowd of people demanding that the scientist come out to them. The academician calls the checkpoint and asks the guard why outsiders were allowed in, he did not invite anyone. The guard replies sarcastically: - So Zhirinovsky was discharged from the hospital and immediately went to beat your face!
