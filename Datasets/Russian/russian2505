The Onanismus hacker association hacked into the servers of the Zazhopugoltrans Zazhopinsky city-forming enterprise. The achievements of the director's secretaries on the Odnoklassniki and Kasynka farms were reset to zero. In a retaliatory attack from MS-DOS from the company's server AT-386, inventory number 362, the secretary's son Vasily Pupkin formatted the files of the Amazon and Meta companies, confirming their trillion-dollar capitalization. The US government demanded the extradition of V. Pupkin and imposed personal sanctions on the secretary and director of Zazhopugoltrans. Currently, work is underway to identify ways to inform these individuals about the sanctions imposed on them.
