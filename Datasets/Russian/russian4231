An interesting incident occurred during the transportation of "refugees" from the DPR. The bus driver jokingly said that the bus was going to the Chechen Republic, after which the "refugees" began to jump out of the bus, tearing Ukrainian passports out of the linings on the go and running away towards the Ukrainian border.
