Beijing, skiing, women. A sleeping agent-skier from Latvia (USSR) committed a diversion by pushing a Norwegian skier into a ditch so that the USSR, represented by Russia, would win the relay at the Olympics from the very beginning! There will be no complaints either, since the USSR is not officially registered as the countries participating in the Olympics!
