A year ago, on Twitter, they presented, but how they sounded, advertising slogans in the past tense. So, the time has come and now these slogans have become relevant. There was an idea - there was IKEA Flatulence had no chance (Espumizan) Lived on the bright side (Beeline) Life was a good thing. Whatever one may say (Rich) We took care of you (Tefal) We worked, you rested (Indesit) Gazprom, dreams came true. Toyota - controlled the dream. We flew Aeroflot planes.
