An idea for a computer game: a person from Vault 146 walks a hundred kilometers from any Russian regional center and tries to figure out whether there was a nuclear war or not. There is no centralized power, bandits rule the places, the ruins of factories, dirt, hairy monkeys jump around and cut the heads of the remnants of the survivors.
