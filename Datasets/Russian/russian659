Judging by the general situation in different countries of the world, the choice of work by graduates of "faculties of management", "faculties of political sciences", etc. upon graduation is directly related to the style of behavior. Those who think a lot and talk little go into science. Those who think less and talk more organize various foundations, advisory companies, and so on. And they are trying to sell their forecasts of human development for money. Somewhere further - they become "political scientists" and "experts". Very narrow-minded, but talkative become deputies, congressmen, senators, etc. And the extremely stupid, but at the same time the most talkative, reach the heights of politics, becoming presidents, prime ministers, ministers of foreign affairs, etc. And only in Russia can one get into politics both "according to global rules" and by chance.
