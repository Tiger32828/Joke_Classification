- That's how I really envy you! I don't understand wine at all. For me, it's either sweet or sour and heartburn for some reason. And here are brands, varieties, years, crops, producers, subtleties, bouquets. It really doesn't fit in my head how to figure it all out. I'm probably doomed. *This comment does not mean insulting the feelings of believers, third world countries, feminists, animals ... I envy you, really! - You're not hopeless, you just need to learn the terminology. Instead of sweet, say "residual sugars appear", instead of sour "wine is full-bodied, with the potential for further maturation", instead of heartburn - "long aftertaste, pronounced tannin with a bias towards excess".
