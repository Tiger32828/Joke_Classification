Doshilis, Fucking jokes? Why did you have to laugh at Anatoly Borisovich yesterday? Chubais was offended, dumped out of the country into someone else's bourgeoisie. How are we now without him? He should have been given a higher position and a higher salary. They didn't save him... Now look after Serdyukov, God forbid, he'll fall too. Effective managers in the West are valuable.
