Whether there will be more ... The EU imposed sanctions on 351 State Duma deputies. Josep Borrell said: â€œNo more shopping in Milan, no more parties in Saint-Tropez, no more diamonds in Antwerp. This is the first step." At the same time, he specified that the sanctions would not affect Russian President Putin. That is, it follows from Borrell's words that Vladimir Putin will be able to go shopping in Milan, attend parties in Saint-Tropez, and buy diamonds in Antwerp. Well, at least someone got lucky! :)
