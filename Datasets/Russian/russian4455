My parents, teachers, friends, "acquaintances" of the police - from childhood instilled in me the feeling that I was born and will live, and in the end I will die a complete loser, but unfortunately and deep envy of all these above-mentioned citizens, I did not live up to their expectations , and was not even going to do this, and in general, deep down, he always did not give a damn about pseudo-public opinion (from the notes of a Russian millionaire).
