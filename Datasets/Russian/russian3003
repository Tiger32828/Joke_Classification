The romance of passenger aviation in the 1930s... Simple piston engines, unhurried travel at a speed of just over 300 km/h and numerous intermediate landings on long-distance routes. Low echelons with air pockets. No automatic landings - everything is "on hand". No satellite navigation - just a view of the area, a magnetic compass, a watch and a radio semi-compass ... GET USED AGAIN!
