Russia wants to seize Ukraine in order to support it with multi-billion dollar subsidies from the federal budget. But Ukrainians, as decent people, do not want to strain Russia, so they live on loans from the EU, straining the budget of the Union of Democratic Capitalist Republics, which is already bursting at the seams. Thank you Ukrainians for your help!
