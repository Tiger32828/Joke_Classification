It's a disgrace why the staging of Shakespeare's pedophile plays is still banned. Juliet is 13 years old there, and with Romeo itâ€™s generally incomprehensible - if he is under 18, then to hell with both of them, but otherwise this is direct propaganda for the corruption of minors. A real problem for the law would happen in our time if Juliet gave herself to Romeo on the occasion of his birthday at exactly midnight.
