Shashlyyk is a Russian national dish (in contrast to shish kebab with one "y", which is the national dish of all 327 nations of the Caucasus and Transcaucasia). The presence of the second, lingering "y" in the name of the dish is due to aspiration and salivation, with which a Russian person speaks and thinks about shish kebab.
