A woman posted an ad: "I'm looking for a man who doesn't like to watch football." One responded: - You are perfect for me! - And you tell me. You really don't like to watch football? - How to say. I follow the results, but I never watch the matches themselves! - This is exactly what I need. Why don't you watch them? - You see, these football players... without bikes... run faster than me - on a bike. And I can't. I can't watch it, I can't!
