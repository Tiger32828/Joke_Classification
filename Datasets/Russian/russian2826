There is a global football match. USA, Germany, France and so on play for one team. In the other - Russia. Judges whistle in one direction. The rules are being changed as they go. The ball (and this is Ukraine) is always given to the "good guys" who shamelessly kick it. But the "bad guys" got tired, and they also kicked the yach. Immediately a universal howl arose: "What are you doing? It hurts the ball!"
