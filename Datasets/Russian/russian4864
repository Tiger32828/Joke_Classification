A herd of sheep is put up for auction. 30 million heads. Along with the ranch. Obedient to goats, stupid but trained, free from hair, mostly castrated, there are thoroughbred individuals for the meat production of lambs. Food credit not paid. So it's on sale for $1. So, gentlemen, who wants to occupy, sorry to buy this herd for only 1 dollar?! 1 dollar one time, 1 dollar two... Number 12 offers 30 rubles. Sales!!!
