- How do you work as a programmer? - Very simple. Just imagine a workshop where statues are made, here is a marble cobblestone, here they come from marketing and say - we need boobs, then they say - we need an ass, then they say - we need a leg. Then the hand, then the hand is not needed, then the second leg. And in the end it turns out - a foot on the head, a head in the ass, an ass on the boobs, and boobs on the legs. And then they tell us: "But we wanted the Venus de Milo ...".
