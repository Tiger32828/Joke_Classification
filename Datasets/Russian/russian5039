You see, gentlemen bankers, - one of the members of the FRS addresses his colleagues, - if we sharply raise the rate of the US Federal Reserve, then we may win inflation. But company shares, prices for raw materials, gas, oil will collapse. Wages will collapse, people will have nothing to eat. Riots will start. And it does not matter that all this will happen in Russia and Ukraine. It will hurt us too, we will not be able to predict the behavior of these Russians!
