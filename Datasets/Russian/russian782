- Dmitry Anatolyevich, how prudently we joined the WTO at one time! - Yes, Vladimir Vladimirovich, if it were not for our wise fateful decision to join, then now the Russian Federation would have raked such sanctions, sho "mom don't cry." And so everything is not even very sad, but even great! After all, strong import substitution is our EVERYTHING!!!
