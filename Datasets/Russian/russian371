I am watching with interest the epidemic of renaming Russian into Ukrainian. I believe that in the summer in San Francisco it will be possible to visit Fort Ukr. And in the latter, drink Ukrainian vodka with Ukrainian borscht, and then ride the Ukrainian slides, and even have fun with Ukrainian roulette.
