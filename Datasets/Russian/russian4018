The office of a very small insurance company in a remote western town. The boss reads the morning papers: some are bankrupt, others are on the verge of bankruptcy, the third does not have long left. She puts down the newspaper, puts a cup of coffee on the table and mutters, rubbing her hands: “So, if the crisis destroys our competitors at such a pace, then in a couple of months we will already be in the top 10 largest insurers.”
