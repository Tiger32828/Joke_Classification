Talleyrand Périgord was a famous politician in modern French history.
At one party he sat between Madame Steele and Madame Recamier, the famous beauty,
His attention was clearly drawn to the latter's beauty.
Mrs. Steele, unwilling to be lonely, interrupted their conversation and said:
"Mr. Talleyrand Périgord, if you, I, and Madame Recar are in the same boat, and the boat is wrecked, and you can only save one person ashore, who will you save?"
Talleyrand Périgord bowed deeply to her and replied:
"Ma'am, you know everything, so of course you must know how to swim."
