One day, a fire broke out in a certain house, and both parents escaped, leaving only one son inside.
The mother was very nervous and shouted outside the house: "Son...what are you doing...it's on fire and still can't come out.."
Son replied: I am wearing socks.
My mother said again: What socks are you wearing when it's all on fire? Stop wearing it!
Five minutes later, the son still did not come out.
The mother shouted nervously: Son, what are you doing? Come out, it's all on fire, stay inside!
Son said: I'm taking off my socks!
