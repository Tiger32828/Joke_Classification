When the coffin was to be buried, the whole family circled around the coffin sadly,
The Taoist priest holds a hammer in his right hand and a nail in his left hand, preparing to seal the coffin.
So when the Taoist put down an iron nail, he recited in his mouth: "The champion will be born from generation to generation!" (Taiwanese)
All the family members replied: "House!" (Taiwanese, this is the custom of burial in Taiwan!)
The Taoist priest ordered another nail and said in his mouth: "The children and grandchildren will open the bus from generation to generation!" (Taiwanese)
All the family members replied: "House!" (Taiwanese)
Not long after, when the Taoist tried to drive down the nails again, he accidentally nailed his own hand.
A natural reaction to scold:
"I'm a motherfucker.." (Taiwanese)
All the family members replied: "House!" (Taiwanese)
