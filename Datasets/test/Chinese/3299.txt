On a hot afternoon, a grandfather was watching TV in the living room with his grandson.
Later, it was so hot that my grandfather wanted to blow the electric fan.
So he said to his grandson, "Go and help grandpa plug in the plug."
At this time, the grandson went to the bathroom and took a towel to wipe his grandfather's big bald head.
