Once upon a time, there was a businessman who went out to buy goods and went home, and bought a mirror by the way to give it to his wife.
When he got home, he rushed to the toilet, put the mirror on the table and left.

His wife had never seen a mirror, and as soon as she saw something shiny on the table,
Picked it up curiously. Looking inside, there is a young woman,
She burst into tears all of a sudden: "This unconscionable thing has only been married for two years, and then came back with a concubine."

She cried and took the mirror to her mother. Her mother took the mirror and looked inside. Seeing that it was an old woman, she comforted her daughter:
"Good boy, don't cry, he won't find an old woman to be his little wife."

When the daughter's father heard about this, he also picked up the mirror and looked in. When he saw an old man inside, he couldn't help laughing:
"He is looking for an old man to manage the accounts, what does it have to do with you?"
