An uncle went to his nephew's house, and as soon as he entered the door, he asked, "Aliang, are your parents here?"
Ah Liang said: My father fell into the water on a business trip.
When my uncle heard this, he was very nervous and asked again: Where is your mother, Ah Liang?
I went to see my father for three days and still didn't come back..
The uncle became more nervous, so he called his sister and asked if the brother-in-law fell into the water and found it.
Sister said: What fell into the water? It was your brother-in-law who was dispatched to the water on a business mission!
