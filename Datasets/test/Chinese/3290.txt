One day, two "fearful" people met together.
A said to B, "Have you heard? A new wine has been introduced recently. As long as you drink a cup, you will no longer be afraid of your wife. Look at me, just drink a cup and you will no longer be afraid of your wife."
B interrupted A's words, sighed and said, "I also heard that I bought a dozen bottles on purpose that day."
A was surprised and asked, "Why are you still sighing after drinking so much? Could it be that you bought fake wine?"
B said frustratedly, "You may not have imagined that as soon as I picked up the wine to drink, I saw my wife open all the remaining wine and pour it into a barrel."
A asked in surprise, "She's going to throw away the wine?"
Yi said with lingering fear: "It's more scary than that, she picked up the bucket and started drinking."
