Last week, a friend from mainland China came to Taiwan and gave me a DVD. I watched this film yesterday. I don't know the name. It is a bit old.
Inside, the actor said something: "Oh..understand.."
The caption below reads: "Oh, I'm standing up below.."
The heroine said: "I am so afraid you do not understand."
The caption below reads: "I'm really afraid you won't be able to stand up below!!"
my face is all red...
