A gaunt patient said to the doctor, "The wild dog outside my window has been barking all night. I'm going crazy!"
The doctor said, "Go back and try these new sleeping pills!"
A week later, the patient came again, looking more haggard and tired than last time.
The doctor asked, "Are those pills effective?"
The patient whimpered and said, "No, I get up every night to chase those wild dogs, but...
Even if it catches one, it won't swallow sleeping pills! "
