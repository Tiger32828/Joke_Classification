This story takes place at a top American university.
In biology class, the professor is explaining that semen contains a high percentage of glucose.
A fresh girl raised her hand and asked, "If I understand correctly, you mean it's supposed to be sweet?"
"Yes!" the professor replied, ready to add some information.
The girl raised her hand again and asked, "Then why doesn't it taste sweet?"
After a dead silence, the whole class burst into laughter, and the poor girl finally understood what she had said or hinted unintentionally,
Blushing, he picked up the textbook and walked out of the classroom without saying a word.
But when she was walking out the door, the professor's response was a classic!
He answered that question: "It doesn't taste sweet, that's because the taste buds for sweetness are on the tip of the tongue, not the back of the throat."
