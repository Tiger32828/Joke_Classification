A certain man, who is first to speak English, goes to the embassy and has a form to fill out, one of which is sex.
The man has been thinking about it for a long time and decided to write: once a week.
The visa officer laughed and said: this item should be filed in with male or female.
The man immediately turned pale, thought about it, and filled in: female
The official was stunned and said, "Shouldn't be male?"
The man said urgently: I am a normal man, So I have sex with female.
