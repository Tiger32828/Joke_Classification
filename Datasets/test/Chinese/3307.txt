There is an official who is most afraid of his wife, and is often scolded by his wife at light level, and beaten by his wife at worst.
Once, his face was scratched by his wife.
When he arrived at the yamen the next day, his immediate superior, the state official, saw him and asked him, "Why is your face broken?"
The man made up a lie and said, "The grape trellis fell and was cut through by the vines while enjoying the shade at night!"
The state official didn't believe it and said, "This must be caught by your wife. The world counts women like this as hateful. Send someone to catch me!"
But this was overheard by the state official's wife in the back hall, and she rushed to the hall with a face full of anger,
When the state official saw his wife, he hurriedly said to someone, "You step back for now, the grape arbor of my postya will also collapse!"
