During the Christmas holiday, Ayong went to a beach in France and saw a French man surrounded by many young and beautiful girls...
Ayong was very curious, so he took the opportunity to ask the French man why he was so attractive to women.
The French man said: "It's very simple, you just put a potato in your swimming trunks."
The next day, Ayong put away the potatoes and went to the beach again, but all the women ignored him completely, and even showed contempt.
So Ah Yong went to the French man again and asked him why it was useless to put potatoes.
The French man looked at A Yong and said, "Potatoes are placed in the front, not in the back..."
