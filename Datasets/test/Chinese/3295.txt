I went to the toilet alone, and there was a woman in the toilet next door. She accidentally lost the toilet paper and was very embarrassed, so she said:
"Who can give me toilet paper, I'd rather marry him."
When the man heard it, he stuffed his paper through the crack in the wall and gave it to the woman.
The woman took the paper and used it, then walked away.
The man here sighed, "Although the marriage is settled, how can this debt be used cleanly?"
