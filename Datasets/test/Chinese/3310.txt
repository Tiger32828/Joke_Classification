There is such a county magistrate, and within a few days of taking office, someone complained that it turned out that the two families had used a knife during a war, and this man killed another man.
The victim's wife cried so hard that the county magistrate was greatly moved:
"Such a young and beautiful daughter-in-law? You killed his husband, wouldn't you let her be a widow?"
So the murderer was sentenced to marry the victim's wife, and after the sentence was over, he said angrily, "Let your former wife experience the taste of widowhood!"
