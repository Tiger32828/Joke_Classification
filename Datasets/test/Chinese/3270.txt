Early in the morning, Tang Seng woke up from his dream and found Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing kneeling on the ground with tears on their faces.
So he asked, "Bajie, Wujing, what happened to you?"
Zhu Bajie said with tears on his face, "Master, I beg you, don't talk in your sleep again next time, okay?"
Sha Wujing: "Yeah, Master, Senior Brother, he has already died with a headshot"
