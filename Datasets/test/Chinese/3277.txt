A teenage boy was lounging on the sofa watching TV when the phone rang.
"Tomorrow, where is your mother?"
"She's mopping the floor."
"What?" cried the father. "She's not as young and strong as she used to be. Why don't you help?"
"I can't help," the son replied. "Another mop is already used by grandma."
