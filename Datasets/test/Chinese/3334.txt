Once upon a time there was a tyrant, and the people hated him.
One hot day, he was walking along the river bank and decided to swim across it. He was originally very good in water, but suddenly cramped after entering the water.
Seems to be drowning! There happened to be two farmers working in the fields nearby, and they came over,
Jumping into the water saved him. When they dragged him ashore, they learned that the man was the king.
The king was very happy, and he said to the two peasants, "You have saved my life, and I will do whatever you want."
Without thinking, the two replied, "Please don't tell the king that we saved your life."
