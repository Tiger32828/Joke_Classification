The priest said: Children, everyone is guilty. What did you do wrong?
The man replied: Father, I stole a cow from someone else, what should I do? I'll give you the cow, okay?
The priest replied: I don't want to. You should return the cow to the owner.
The man said: But he said he didn't want to.
The priest said: Then you can accept it yourself.
result....
When the priest came home that night, he found that his cow was missing.
