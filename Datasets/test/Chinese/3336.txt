There was a playboy who got sick because he played too aggressively.
After seeing several Western doctors in a row, the doctors all told him, "You can't do it here, you must cut it off!"
How can the playboy be willing! Go to see a doctor.
The doctor looked at it and said, "Although it's too late, um... but it's okay!"
"Really? But I've seen a lot of Western doctors and they say it must be cut off."
The doctor said: "Western medicine is like this, you have to cut anything at every turn.
Take this bottle of medicine and apply it three times a day before it will fall off on its own! "
