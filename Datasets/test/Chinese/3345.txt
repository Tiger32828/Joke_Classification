There is a lady who likes to take advantage of her personality.
One day, there was a big sale of famous brand clothes in Manhattan, New York, and she went to pick the cheap ones.
After choosing and choosing, I finally picked one, but the style is trendy, and I am not sure whether it is women's or men's clothing.
It just so happened that a tall, strong and dark male waiter came towards her,
Just ask him in English: "For boy or girl?"
The waiter replied: "Unisex!"
She heard "You need sex", isn't it sexual harassment!
Afraid that he heard it wrong, he showed a look of astonishment and doubt.
Upon seeing this, the waiter explained letter by letter: "U-N-1-SEX!"
This time she heard clearly...
"You and I Sex!"
