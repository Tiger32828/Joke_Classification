One day, there were three good friends named A, B, and C.
A said, "Yesterday I had sex with my wife five times, and my wife said, 'Husband, I love you so much!'"
Yi smiled and said, "What's so great about this, yesterday I did it seven times with my wife, and my wife said, "Husband, I can't live without you...""
A and B looked at them proudly and said, "How about you?"
C: "I only did it once yesterday..."
A and B smiled and said, "Then what did your wife say?"
C: "She said: 'Husband~ let's take a break, shall we?'"
