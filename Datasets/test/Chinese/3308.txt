Qian, who was so drunk in the wine field one day, stumbled into the women's toilet in a daze.
He vomited in the cubicle. At this time, a lady went to the toilet to relieve herself. Qian heard the sound of her urination and mistakenly thought that someone was pouring beer.
Angrily said: I already said that I don't drink, who is falling?
The lady was startled when she heard the words, so she held back her urination, wanting to wait for the money to go away.
Mr. Qian was furious when he heard a fart.
He slapped the clapboard with his hands and scolded loudly: I said I would stop drinking, who opened another bottle? Who drives who drinks!
