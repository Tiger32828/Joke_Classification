Xiao Yuan didn't understand, he took advantage of the invigilator's turn around,
Then he secretly asked the same table, and the same table replied in a low voice: "The sun shines on the Sanggan River"
Xiao Yuan wrote it immediately.

Suddenly he burst out laughing. It turned out that he wrote: "The Sun Shines on Three Monks"
