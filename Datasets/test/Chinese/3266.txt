There was a cow slaughterer who passed the house of a pig slaughterer, and his son wanted to taboo the word slaughtering a pig, so he replied, "My family has gone out of Hai."
When the slaughterer returned, he told his son about it, and praised it, and the son also understood it. The next day, the pig slaughterer arrived, and his son replied, "My father went out to make a fool of himself."
Ask: "When will you be back?"
He replied, "After all the ugliness, it will come back naturally."
