One day the turtle and his friends went to the beach to play
Friend: "I'm so thirsty~ Would you like to buy a drink?"
The turtle went to buy a drink..
His friend stayed where he was and waited
One day, two days, three days~ The turtle has not come back
The friend couldn't help but complain loudly: "I bought a drink for so long~ What is this turtle doing!"
At this moment came the sound of turtles in the distance
"I won't go any more if you quarrel!"
