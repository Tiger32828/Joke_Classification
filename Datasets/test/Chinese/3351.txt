There is an older grandpa. Recently, some social welfare groups have issued pensions for the elderly.
Grandpa went to collect the old man's annuity, but he didn't have any documents with him.
The lady asked Grandpa, "Then you don't have any documents, how do I know how old you are?"
(My grandfather can't tell how old he is when his hair is bald!)
Grandpa said, "I have chest hair, and my chest hair is all white, which can prove how old I am!"
He took off his clothes and showed the hair on his chest to the lady. It was really white, so the lady gave him an old-age pension.
When Grandpa returned, he was very proud and said to his wife, "Look! I am so witty today! After taking off my clothes and showing the young lady my chest hair, she will give me an old man's pension!"
As a result, his wife told him disdainfully:
"You should take off your pants and show her, you can also receive a disability pension!"
