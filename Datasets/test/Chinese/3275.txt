After a heavy thunderstorm, a farmer was chasing ducks on the road, and a man who drove the Benches stopped and asked, "Is the water in front of you not deep?"
Farmer: "It's safe! It's good to go!"
As a result, Mercedes drove over with confidence, but did not expect to sink deeper and deeper into the water, and the owner of the car shouted anxiously, "Aren't you right?"
Farmer: "How do I know? The ducks just passed by, and the water only reaches the buttocks!"
