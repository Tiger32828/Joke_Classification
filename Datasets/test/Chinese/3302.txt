The Boeing 777 is the first aircraft ever designed and built entirely in computer virtual reality.
The equipment used was entirely provided by IBM Corporation.
Before the test flight, the president of Boeing warmly invited IBM's technical director to participate in the test flight.
But the supervisor said, "Ah, it's a great honor, but unfortunately it's my wife's birthday, so..."
Boeing's general carrier got angry when he heard it: "Coward, I haven't told you the date of the test flight!".
