A college student went to the zoo to apply for summer working students.
After entering the zoo, the boss gave him an orangutan costume. It turned out that the orangutan in the zoo was sick, so he asked the student to play the role of the orangutan.
In this way, he was swinging around in the garden to show tourists. He even became interested in swinging and began to show all kinds of tricks to tourists.
I didn't expect to accidentally swing to the tiger area next door.
Seeing the tiger walking towards him like this, he was very frightened and could only meditate in his heart: Namo Amitabha, Namo Amitabha.
The tiger went further and further, and finally approached his face and said to him:
"Don't be afraid, junior, I'll immediately ask the administrator to send you back!"
