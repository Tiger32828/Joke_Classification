A man went to see a psychiatrist because of his sexual life problems. The doctor asked him many questions, but he didn't see the crux.
Finally, the doctor asked, "Did you see your girlfriend's face during sex?"
"I saw it once."
"how is the situation?"
"She looked angry."
At this point, the doctor felt that he had found the answer.
"This is the crux of the problem. Sex should be an exchange of feelings between two people. You obviously ignored her feelings!"
"Then under what circumstances did you see her angry face?"
"Oh, she was standing outside the window looking at us."
