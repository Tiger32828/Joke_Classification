There are two alcoholics.
One day, the two invited each other to have a drink, but found that the sum of money on them was only more than 200 yuan.
One of them said to the other, "It's okay, look at me."
They went to a 7-11 and bought two hot dogs, tucked the hot dogs into their crotch respectively, and then went into the hotel to drink.
When they were almost drinking, they jumped into each other's pants and sucked hot dogs.
The bartender of the hotel angrily yelled at them when he saw it:
"Get out! Don't do such filthy things in my shop!!"
They drank eight in a row in this way.
One of them said to the other, "I'm so tired from drinking today!"
Another said: "I'm so tired! My hot dog fell off at the second house!"
