I remember that after the college entrance examination that year, knowing that the test was not very good, I told my father truthfully that the test results were not ideal, etc.,
The father said helplessly: "If it doesn't work, just repeat it."
At this time, the grandfather sitting next to him said angrily, "If you don't pass the test, you won't pass the test. What kind of poison are you taking?!"
It's still grandpa~
