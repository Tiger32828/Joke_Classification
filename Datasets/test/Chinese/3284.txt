A typical big man married a typical little beauty, the wedding just ended,
The big man established the following rules:
_x0008_ "I can go home whenever I want, as long as I want, no matter when I want, you can't make it difficult for me!
You have to prepare a good dinner for me every night unless I tell you I'm not coming back.
I can go out hunting, fishing, drinking, or playing cards with my old friends whenever I want, and you can't make it hard for me!
That's my rule... do you have an opinion? "

His bride said in a big way:
"No problem, you are very thoughtful for me. I just remind you to remember one thing, have sex on time at seven o'clock every night - whether you are there or not!"
