Avanti was over seventy years old. One day, he refused to accept his old age and tried to move a large stone in the yard.
This move broke him, his waist was twisted, and his anger was not smooth. Since then, he has been bedridden.
Many relatives and friends came to visit him.
He said to those who comforted him: "Please don't be sad, my body is the same as when I was young, and my strength has not diminished at all."
"How do you see it?" the people asked.
"The big rock in our yard, I moved it when I was young, and I didn't move it, I tried it a few days ago,
Still haven't moved, don't you see my strength is the same as when I was young? "Avanti said.
