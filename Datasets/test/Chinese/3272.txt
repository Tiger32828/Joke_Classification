One day, the woman saw a wasp flying into the house and shouted to her husband, "There's a wasp here, do we still have the spray?"
The husband told her there was a jar under the sink.
"Honey~" she cried, "it's a spray for ants and cockroaches."
"Well," the husband replied, "don't let it see the label."
