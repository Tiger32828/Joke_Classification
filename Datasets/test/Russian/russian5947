Dear Mr. Sobyanin! We, in our simple Russian village without roads, gas or central water supply, decided to accept your proposal and also participate in choosing a name for a new high-speed diameter connecting the southern and northern regions of Moscow. We inform you that among the literary ones, the option "Fucked to the edge" won.
