They say that gender identification, in other words - the sex of a person - is subjective. If you want, you consider yourself a woman, but if you want - a man ... If this is so, then the same applies to the ethnic group, race. Here we are, for example, white men - we can begin to consider ourselves black lesbian women, and no one can say something against it! Yes, because black lives matter, so come on, kneel before us! )
